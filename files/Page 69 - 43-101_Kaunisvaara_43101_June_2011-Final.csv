Summary												
Introduction												
This technical report has been prepared for Northland Resources AB (Northland) by SRK Consulting												
(UK) Ltd (SRK) in connection with the publication by Northland of the Kaunisvaara Feasibility Study												
and Northland’s reporting requirements related to the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX). Northland has												
been listed on the TSX since 2003 (as North American Gold) and is principally an iron exploration												
and development company with properties in northern Sweden and Finland. This report describes the												
results of an updated review of the Kaunisvaara Feasibility Study (the Feasibility Study) which												
comprises the exploitation of the Sahavaara and Tapuli iron ore projects in northern Sweden (the												
Mineral Assets). The original review had an effective date of 3 October 2010 while this update												
incorporates the results of amended concentrate logistics studies undertaken by Northland and												
"reviewed by SRK, updated reserve estimates produced by SRK and an updated Technical Economic"												
Model prepared by SRK which reflects all the changes made and revised iron ore price assumptions.												
The Kaunisvaara project is a late stage exploration project which when constructed will comprise two												
conventional open pit mines and a magnetite processing operation producing a concentrate product.												
"Associated infrastructure includes access, service and dumper roads, a waste water treatment plant,"												
"two process plant buildings, two stockpile buildings, an administration building, workshops and truck"												
"bays, stores building metallurgical laboratory, plant services building, two pump station buildings and"												
an assay laboratory.												
SRK prepared the Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve estimates presented in the Feasibility Study												
"and provided direct geotechnical, hydrological, waste rock management and Acid Rock Drainage"												
"inputs to the Tapuli and Sahavaara mine design assumed by this. In preparing this report, SRK has in"												
addition reviewed those aspects of the Feasibility Study completed by Northland and its other												
contractors and consultants to a sufficient level to enable SRK to present its own opinions on the												
project and an audited NPV for this.												
"The Kaunisvaara project comprises two iron ore deposits: Tapuli and Sahavaara, located"												
approximately 100 km north of the Arctic Circle in the municipality of Pajala and near the village of												
Kaunisvaara. The Sahavaara deposit is located close to the centre of the Kaunisvaara village. This has												
"been historically been referred to as ""Stora Sahavaara"", but given the use of the name “Sodra"												
"Sahavaara” for one of the mineralised lenses identified, Northland has now generalized the name to"												
simply Sahavaara. The Tapuli deposit is located approximately 4 km to the north of Sahavaara. The												
"Tapuli project comprises Palotieva to the north and Tapuli to the south, the latter comprising the"												
majority of the contained resource.												
Location/Licence												
Both Sahavaara and Tapuli are located within the Sahavaara No. 2 exploration licence. Tapuli is also												
covered by the Tapuli No. 1 and 2 exploitation concessions. The Sahavaara No. 2 Exploration permit												
"covers an area of some 16,456 hectares."

"By road, the town of Pajala is located approximately 210 km north of the major city of Lulea, which"												
"has 70,000 inhabitants, and about 180 km from Rovaniemi in Finland which has 40,000 inhabitants."												
"Access from Lulea is possible by following the E4 coastal road 55 km to Tore, turning north on E10"												
and following this for another 50 km to Overkalix and then turning right on road 392 north to Pajala												
"for another 105 km. Access from Rovaniemi can be gained by driving on Route 79, turning off after"												
"21 km on Route 83 at Sinetti to Pello, which is then 98 km from Rovaniemi and where the"												
international border is crossed into Sweden. Taking Route 402 west for 5 km and then Route 99 north												
for a distance of 52 km the town of Pajala is reached.												
History												
Prospecting over an area to the northeast of Pajala in the province of Norbotten in 1918 resulted in five												
"“ironstone” or magnetite deposits being discovered. From north to south these were Palotieva, Tapuli,"												
"and the Stora, Ostra and Sodra Sahavaara ironstone occurrences. During the 1940s, Boliden AB"												
discovered the Ruutijarvi ironstone occurrence. The Swedish Geological Survey (SGU) is credited												
"with subsequently discovering a faulted extension of Ruutijarvi called “Blind Ruutijarvi”. In 1958, the"												
"SGU, led by prospectors from the Johnson Company, discovered the Karhujarvi and Suksivuoma"												
"magnetite deposits, also located in the Kaunisvaara Iron Ore Field. In the 1960s the SGU, with"												
"funding and technical assistance from LKAB, began the Iron Ore Inventory Program in the province"												
of Norbotten as part of which ground magnetic and gravity surveys were conducted over the northern												
portion of the Kaunisvaara Field focusing on Tapuli and Stora Sahavaara. Diamond drilling												
commenced in 1961 on the Sahavaara occurrences and throughout the early 1960s exploration of Stora												
"Sahavaara progressed, leading to the delineation of a resource. During the latter part of the 1960s"												
"exploration focused on the Tapuli deposit, leading to the delineation of an additional resource."												
"Initial resource delineation drilling commenced at Sahavaara in 1960 and continued for five years,"												
"during which time 46 drillholes were completed for 11,798 m. Drilling by the SGU in the 1970s"												
"increased the number of drillholes to 50 for a total of 12,018 m. The SGU commenced resource"												
"delineation drilling at Tapuli in 1965 and continued for five years, during which time 26 drillholes"												
"were completed for 6,280 m."												
A Mineral Resource Estimate for the Sahavaara iron deposit was prepared by Dr Bart Stryhas in 2006												
"as an independent consultant to Northland. This was subsequently adopted by Chlumsky, Armbrust"												
"and Meyer, LLC (CAM) and presented in the “Technical Report, Sahavaara Project, Northern"												
"Sweden”, CAM, 29 June 2006 which was filed with the System for Electronic Document Analysis and"												
"Retrieval (SEDAR) on 4 July 2006. In total, CAM reported the Sahavaara project to contain 144.7 Mt"												
of iron ore at a mean grade of 43.1% Fe Total.												
A historic Mineral Resource Estimate for the Tapuli iron deposit was prepared by Thomas Lindholm												
and Dibya Kanti Mukhopadhyay in 2008 as independent consultants to Northland. This was												
subsequently adopted by GeoVista AB (GeoVista) and presented in the “Tapuli Resource Estimate”												
and filed with the System for Electronic Document Analysis and Retrieval (SEDAR) on 23 January												
"2009. In total, GeoVista reported the iron ore resource at Tapuli to be 103.9 Mt at a mean grade of"												
26.2% Fe.

Geology												
"Glacial till, gravel, and sand cover the entire Kaunisvaara project area and bedrock exposures are very"												
"rare, nearly nonexistent. Large parts of the area are furthermore covered with wetlands with variable"												
"thickness, from up to 8 to 10 m in the extremes. Much of the geological interpretation therefore relies"												
on information from drill-core as well as from regional and local geophysical data.												
The deposits of the Kaunisvaara project are located adjacent to the westernmost thrust fault of the												
Pajala Shear Zone (PSZ) along the margin of the Karelian craton. The supracrustal rocks of the area												
"consist of Karelian (2.5-2.0 Ga) quartzites, dolomitic marbles, black schists, mica schists and mafic"												
metavolcanic rocks along with minor Svecofennian (1.96-1.85 Ga) phyllites and quartzitic phyllites.												
The intrusives in the immediate area of the deposits are dominantly gabbro and diabase (1.89-1.77 Ga)												
with relatively late-orogenic granites (1.82-1.79 Ga) to the west. Metasomatic skarns occur in												
"association with the magnetite deposits (Kaunisvaara PEA, 2009)."												
The Sahavaara deposit occurs as a continuous “seam” located between a hanging-wall quartzite and												
footwall graphitic schist. Minor remnants of skarn-altered dolomite occur within the deposit and likely												
"reflect the original protolith. At Sahavaara, the mineralisation consists of one main lens and a smaller"												
adjacent mineralised lens. The main mineralisation domain (Stora Sahavaara) has a NNE-SSW												
"orientated strike length of 1300 m, dips at 50-70 degrees to the west, plunges to the north and is"												
concordant with the host sedimentary rocks. The mineralisation is generally open down-dip below the												
"limits of the resource model. The mineralisation comprises magnetite, serpentine, pyrrhotite, pyrite,"												
"and tremolite. Phlogopite, diopside, chlorite, talc, valleriite, chalcopyrite, graphite, scapolite,"												
"vesuvianite, and apatite also occur as minor constituent minerals."												
The bedrock at Tapuli consists of Precambrian supracrustal sedimentary sequences. The deposit												
"occurs as set of strata-bound, semi-continuous, tabular bodies. The mineralisation comprises"												
"magnetite with occasional trace amounts of chalcopyrite, pyrite, pyrrhotite, and tochinilite."												
Recent Exploration												
"During 2005, Northland drilled 14 diamond core holes at Sahavaara for a total of 2,424 m and during"												
"2007, a further 37 diamond core holes at Tapuli for a total of 5,695 m. There were three objectives to"												
the drilling programs: to twin historic SGU drillholes; to collect fresh metallurgical samples; and to												
expand the current resource with both infill and step-out drilling.												
"At Sahavaara and as a result of the drilling, two mineralization wireframes were digitized using"												
Datamine software; Stora Sahavaara and Sodra Sahavaara. Stora is the larger and contains the most												
"drillhole intercepts. It measures 1.2 km along strike (on a 015° azimuth), and 10 - 80 m across strike,"												
being fairly consistent along the strike length. It was modelled to an elevation of -600 m (dipping 60-												
"65° to the west), and contains 36.9 million m3 of material."												
"Sodra measures 1.2 m along strike (on a 050° azimuth), and 5 -65 m across strike. It was also modeled"												
"to a depth of -600 m (dipping 50-60° to the west), and contains 18.5 million m3 of material."

"At Tapuli, as a result of the drilling, two mineralization wireframes were digitized using Datamine"												
software; Tapuli and Palotieva. Tapuli is by far larger and contains the most drillhole intercepts. It												
"measures 2.7 km along strike (1.8 km on a 055° azimuth, and 0.9 km on a 025° azimuth), and 10 -"												
"250 m across strike, with the northern and southern ends being thinner than the central portion. It was"												
"modeled to an elevation of -300 m (dipping 40-60° to the northwest), and contains 64.6 million m3 of"												
material.												
"Palotieva measures 360 m along strike (on a 70° azimuth), and 10 -30 m across strike. It was also"												
"modeled to a depth of -300 m (dipping 60° to the northwest), and contains 7.7 million m3 of material."												
It is reported that the SGU utilized a standard professional protocol for the sampling for all deposits in												
the Iron Ore Inventory project and indeed it is readily apparent that the sampling intervals commence												
and finish based on visual estimates of magnetite mineralisation. Irregular sample lengths were used												
"within these intervals, ranging between 0.2 and 6.0 m at Sahavaara, the most commonly used being 1"												
or 2 m. The core size was 46 mm and the core was halved for the sampling. The selected sample												
"sections were sawed in half at LKAB’s facility in Kiruna, and drill cores were stored in an"												
underground archive in Kiruna. A limited number of the holes are still held in storage at the SGU												
national core archive in Mala.												
"Northland sampled all the mineralised zones, along with a reasonable amount of altered skarn above"												
the magnetite-bearing material and up to about 10 m of footwall rocks to ensure that the mineralisation												
was entirely captured. Sample intervals started and stopped slightly beyond the visual limits of the												
"mineralised skarn zone. Within these boundaries, the standard sample interval was 1 m. Once the"												
"geologic and geotechnical logging was completed, the sample intervals were marked onto the core"												
boxes and photographed.												
"SRK was not involved with any of the sampling procedures, so cannot comment on the security or"												
handling along the sample chain.												
"Northland maintains its own QA/QC programme consisting of inserting blanks, duplicates and"												
"standards to the analytical process. It is the opinion of SRK, however, that an insufficient number of"												
samples have been incorporated in to the sample stream to date. Given that some 17% of the database												
"comprises historical data with no historic QAQC reporting possible, this makes such checks on the"												
"more recent drilling even more important. It is also the opinion of SRK that the chosen blank, being a"												
"diabase with an inherent Fe and S content, is not suitable for purpose and that grade deviations in the"												
results of the blank samples could be attributed to either the poor homogeneity of the blank or												
laboratory contamination.												
While the results of the laboratory duplicates show that a reasonable level of confidence can be												
"attributed to the more recent drill samples used in the Mineral Resource Estimate, SRK has"												
recommended that henceforth at least 10% of assays are check assayed and that this is supplemented												
"by the use of certified standards, appropriate blank samples, laboratory duplicates and the addition of"												
field duplicates to check the sample preparation processes.												
Northland obtained the original hardcopies of drill logs and assays from the SGU. A verification												
"exercise was conducted on the historic data, which included a review of drillhole logs and plot, the"												
verification of the location of drill collars and a review of drillhole surveys and orientation data. In												
addition twin-hole programmes were set up for each project to check for lithology and assay												
reliability.

The twin-hole program at Sahavaara comprised three holes. While there is generally a good												
"correlation between Northland’s drilling and the historical drilling of SGU, the results from two of the"												
twinned drillholes confirmed the significant short-range variability in both grade and thickness.												
The first of the two holes twinned at Tapuli show very good correlation while the second exhibited												
somewhat less correlation. This is probably due to inaccurate collaring of the hole which resulted in it												
deviating some 15 degrees from the original SGU hole resulted in a large spatial difference between												
the samples.												
Resource Estimation												
The most up to date Mineral Resource and Reserve estimates for the Kaunisvaara project were												
produced by SRK in 2010 for inclusion in the Feasibility Study. The Mineral Resource estimates given												
in this report are presented inclusive of those transferred to Mineral Reserves and are therefore not												
additional to these.												
"The preliminary statistical review undertaken showed that magnetite, being the principal Fe source for"												
"the project, is present within the various logged skarn lithologies at Sahavaara and Tapuli. A review of"												
"the Magnasat data shows that with increasing %Fe Total content, an increasing magnetic signature"												
"with a linear relationship is observed. Additionally, through the visual inspection of the diamond drill"												
"core for the various logged lithologies, it is clear that magnetite is present within the lower grade skarn"												
"lithologies, although clearly disseminated."												
"Notwithstanding the above, SRK recognises that a portion of the %Fe Total, especially in the lower"												
"grade skarn lithologies, will be related to Fe silicates, though this is concentrated within material with"												
a %Fe Total content of less than 10%. Whilst Fe silicates may be present within material with a Fe												
"Total grade in excess of 10%, there is clearly a dominant magnetite content in this material and given"												
this a lower boundary of 10%Fe Total was used to separate the mineralised from the none mineralised												
skarn units at both Sahavaara and Tapuli.												
At Sahavaara an upper cut-off of 50%Fe Total was used to generate a continuous high grade domain												
"and at both Sahavaara and Tapuli, internal zones of continuous un-mineralised skarn were also"												
"domained based on a 10%Fe Total grade. At Tapuli, additional domains were created that separated"												
out high and low sulfur zones. The 10% Fe Total mineralisation domain created for Tapuli is also												
cross cut by vertical fault structures with the mineralisation domain abutting against the faults in												
places.												
"Directional experimental semi-variograms were produced for Fe Total, Al2O3, CaO, K2O, MgO, Mn,"												
"P, S, SiO2 and TiO2. The semi-variograms were produced using a 4 m (composite length) lag in the"												
downhole direction allowing the short-scale structures and nugget variance to be determined. At												
"Sahavaara, along strike (022°) and down-dip (63° to the west) variograms were then produced with the"												
"nugget fixed from the downhole variogram, and using a lag spacing of 50 m with a 50% tolerance"												
being applied to the lag spacing. This spacing was chosen to mirror the minimum drillhole spacing												
within the Sahavaara project. No plunge has been identified by Northland and none was evident from												
the variography.

"At Tapuli, along strike (060°) and down-dip (45° to the northwest) variograms were produced with the"												
"nugget fixed from the downhole variogram, and using a lag spacing of 50 m with a 50% tolerance"												
being applied to the lag spacing. This spacing was chosen to mirror the minimum drillhole spacing in												
the along strike direction. No plunge has been identified by Northland and none was evident from the												
variography.												
"In summary, robust variograms were produced for both Sahavaara and Tapuli and in the downhole,"												
along-strike and down-dip directions and for all element fields. The results of the variography were												
used in the interpolation to assign the appropriate weighting to the samples pairs being utilised to												
calculate the block model grade. The total ranges modelled have also been used to help define the												
"optimum search parameters and the search ellipse dimensions used in the interpolation. Ideally,"												
sample pairs that fall within the range of the variogram where a strong covariance exists between the												
sample pairs should be utilised if the data allows. Applying a 2/3rd rule to the total range of the												
variograms in the search ellipse dimensions forces the interpolation to use samples where the												
covariance between samples exists.												
"As a result of the variography, ordinary kriging (OK) was deemed the most appropriate interpolation"												
technique with a Quantitative Kriging Neighbourhood Analysis (QKNA) being undertaken prior to												
interpolation. QKNA provides a useful technique that uses mathematically sound tools to optimise a												
search area. It is an invaluable step in determining the correct search area for any estimation or												
simulation exercise.												
"A three dimensional block model was constructed for the resource region, covering all the interpreted"												
mineralisation domains and including suitable additional waste material to allow pit optimisation												
studies.												
"At Sahavaara, an empty block model was generated using the mineralisation and host lithology"												
wireframes with blocks of 25mY by 10mX by 12mZ dimension. A block width of 10m was chosen												
"due to the overall dimensions of the mineralisation. At Tapuli, an empty block model was generated"												
using the mineralisation and host lithology wireframes with blocks of 25mY by 25mX by 12mZ												
"dimension. In both cases, the block dimensions approximate half the drillhole spacing along strike"												
(25 m) and the assumed working bench height of the operating pit (12 m).												
"In the ore domains at Sahavaara, a total of 1,202 density samples are present from the post 1960s era"												
"drilling and at Tapuli, 1,605 density samples are present within the key domains. A strong correlation"												
exists between %Fe Total and density and it was therefore deemed appropriate to interpolate the												
density values into the block model via a regression formula based on the %Fe Total grade. Each plot												
has been fitted with a second order polynomial trendline and the resultant equation was used to												
calculate a unique density for each block in the block model upon completion of the interpolation.												
"In addition, a total of 310 density measurements have been taken from the different waste domains at"												
"Sahavaara, and 764 at Tapuli. Average density values were calculated from these and were applied to"												
the block model for the various waste domains identified.												
"Grades of Fe, Al2O3, CaO, K2O, MgO, Mn, P, S, SiO2, and TiO2 were interpolated into the model"												
using OK and the kriging parameters determined from the variography and QKNA study.

"To classify the Sahavaara and Tapuli deposits, the following key indicators were used:"												
"•	geological complexity;"												
"•	quality of data used in the estimation:"												
"o	QAQC, density analysis"												
"•	results of the geostatistical analysis"												
"o	variography, and"												
"o	QKNA results; and"												
"•	quality of the estimated block model."												
"To determine the final Mineral Resource Statement, and so as to comply with the CIM guidelines, the"												
resulting blocks were subjected to a Whittle pit optimisation exercise to determine the proportion of												
the material defined that has a reasonable prospect of economic extraction. This exercise is not												
intended to generate a Mineral Reserve and was purely used to assist in determining at what depth to												
limit the reported resource.												
The Mineral Resource Statement generated by SRK has been restricted to all classified material falling												
within a Whittle shell derived assuming a metal price of 110 US0/dmtu per dry metric tonne unit												
(dmtu) for magnetite concentrate and represents the material which SRK considers has reasonable												
prospect for eventual economic extraction. Table 1 shows the resulting Mineral Resource Statement												
for Sahavaara and Table 2 shows the resulting Mineral Resource Statement for Tapuli.												
The statement has been reported by Qualified Person Howard Baker (MAusIMM) in accordance with												
the CIM Standards on Mineral Resources and Reserves (the CIM Code) prepared by the Canadian												
"Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum and has an effective date of 26th March, 2010."												
"The quantity and grade of the reported inferred resource are uncertain in nature, there has been"												
insufficient exploration to define these as an indicated or measured mineral resource; and it is												
uncertain if further exploration will result in upgrading them to an indicated or measured mineral												
resource category in due course.												
"In total, SRK has derived a combined Measured plus Indicated Mineral Resource for Sodra Sahavaara"												
"and Stora Sahavaara of 86.8 Mt grading 39.82%Fe Total, 1.93%S, 18.26% SiO2 and 14.63% MgO. Of"												
"this, 30.2 Mt grading 42.96%Fe Total and 2.66%S has been reported as Measured and 56.6 Mt grading"												
38.14%Fe Total and 1.55%S as Indicated. In addition some 34.7 Mt grading 37.28%Fe Total and 1.44;												
%S has been reported as an Inferred Mineral Resource. Some 13.8 Mt of the Measured plus Indicated												
Mineral Resource comprises “high grade” material and has a mean grade of 53.38%Fe Total and												
3.03%S.												
In addition SRK has derived a Measured plus Indicated Mineral Resource for Tapuli of 107.4Mt												
"grading 26.01%Fe Total, 0.23 S%, 26.99% SiO2 and 17.47% MgO. Of this, 52.8 Mt grading 27.02"												
%Fe Total and 0.23 %S has been reported as Measured and 54.6 Mt grading 25.04 %Fe Total and 0.24

Reserve Estimation												
The Feasibility Study reports a Mineral Reserve for the project as defined by the CIM Code and also												
derived by SRK which is based on the above Mineral Resource Estimate.												
"Specifically, SRK derived optimised pits for the Project based on the material reported as Measured"												
and Indicated Mineral Resources. The operating costs assumed for the optimisation were agreed												
between SRK and Northland while the metallurgical recoveries were provided by Bo Arvidson												
"Associates. Two separate designed pits were then developed from the optimised pits, Tapuli and"												
Sahavaara. Table 3 below presents the Mineral Reserve estimate derived following this process.												
These tonnages have been based on a long term price forecast of 150 US0/dmtu. The tonnes and												
grades reported are undiluted and do not have a mining recovery factor applied. Given the relatively												
"homogeneous nature of the ore lenses, SRK does not believe the application of such factors would be"												
material in this case.

"SRK is confident that sufficient geological work has been undertaken, and sufficient geological"												
"understanding gained, to enable the construction of an orebody model suitable for the derivation of"												
Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve estimates. SRK considers that both the modelling and the												
grade interpolation have been carried out in an unbiased manner and that the resulting grade and												
"tonnage estimates should be reliable within the context of the classification applied. In addition, SRK"												
"is not aware of any metallurgical, infrastructural, environmental, legal, title, taxation, socio-economic"												
or marketing issues that would impact on the mineral resource or reserve statements as presented.

Mine Design												
Engineered pit designs have been completed for both deposits. The Sahavaara deposit is mined via a												
"single pit, while the Tapuli deposit is composed of a large, elongated central pit and a small satellite"												
pit to the north east. The Tapuli pit contains 333.9Mt of material comprised of 94.5Mt of ore at a												
grade of 26.3% Fe and 239.4Mt of waste. The Sahavaara pit contains 373.1Mt of material comprised												
of 70.4Mt of ore at a grade of 41.4% Fe and 302.8Mt of waste. Prior to production commencing at												
"each cutback within both deposits, the overburden will need to be stripped. The schedule has been"												
designed to ensure mine production is not affected by the overburden stripping operation. All												
cutbacks will be stripped prior to the commencement of mining operations.												
The project requires 12Mt of crusher feed per annum (combined from both deposits). The maximum												
total annual material movement for the Tapuli deposit is 28Mtpa. The maximum total material												
movement for the Sahavaara deposit is 42Mtpa.												
"The pit design assumes a surface mine operation using drill and blasting operations, a mixed fleet of"												
tracked and wheel loading equipment and conventional haul trucks.												
"Drilling and blasting will be performed on 12 m high benches, with blasted material excavated in a"												
"single pass. It has been assumed that all of the mined material will require blasting, except for the thin"												
layer of overburden. Planned grade control measures include blast hole sampling. Northland has												
indicated that these measures will be reviewed after the commencement of ore production to determine												
if any additional grade control measures are required.												
The haul roads have been designed to suit a Caterpillar 793D (228 t capacity) or equivalent dump												
truck with an operating width of 7.5m. A 30m wide dual lane ramp allows for a safe operating width												
of 2.5 truck widths plus windrows and drainage with single lane access for the last 36 vertical metres												
(3 benches) of depth in the pits. The ramp gradient has been designed at 10%.												
A minimum mining width of 100m has been assumed where possible to suit an excavator and 228t												
rigid body off-highway truck. This mining width allows cutbacks to progress without effecting												
productivity by mining smaller tight cutbacks. There will be sections of each bench that are less than												
"the designed minimum mining width, however these areas have been minimised."												
A crushing station location has been designed close to the exit of each pit. Ore will be hauled by												
trucks to this crushing station and dumped. Material has been planned to be direct tipped into the												
crusher without the need for a large Run of Mine (ROM) stockpile. A conveyor system will feed the												
material from the respective crushing station to a processing facility located adjacent to the Tapuli												
deposit.												
A small ROM stockpile has been planned adjacent to the crushing station at each pit to account for												
operational delays and minor crusher breakdowns. This stockpile will be utilised during the												
commissioning phase of the crushing and processing facility whilst the pit develops to a state that												
production can be maintained.												
"The mine is planned to operate for 365 working days per year, with mining being carried out on a"												
rotating shift policy. A 5 panel shift pattern has been created that incorporates both 8 hour and 12												
hour shifts. The mining aspects of the project will employ approximately 300 permanent employees.

Mineral Processing/Plant Design												
Magnetite iron ore from the Tapuli and Sahavaara pits will be upgraded in a processing plant to be												
located at Kaunisvaara. The predominant economic mineral at both deposits is magnetite. The												
Sahavaara ore also contains pyrrhotite which is weakly magnetic and reports with the magnetite and												
has to be removed from the concentrate by flotation.												
The 12 Mtpa processing plant will comprise two streams. Stream 1 on the northern side of the plant												
will treat ore from the Tapuli pit and Stream 2 on the southern side will treat ore from the Sahavaara												
pit. Each stream will be designed to treat 6 Mtpa of ore per year at a nominal processing rate of 761												
tph. These streams will be similar and will operate independently of each other with the exception of												
"the plant utility systems (such as water, reagents and compressed air), the final tailings pumping"												
"system, the final concentrate filtration system and the concentrate storage and truck load-out which"												
will serve both streams.												
"Over the life of the mine, the total concentrate production will be similar from each pit. The average"												
yield over project life will be approximately 35.9%. The overall grade of the magnetite concentrate												
"produced will be approximately 69% Fe and it will contain < 0.05% S, < 1% SiO2 and < 2 to 3%"												
MgO. The MgO figure is high compared to other concentrates on the market (typically 0.02 to 0.48%												
MgO) and consequently the concentrate will have to form part of a blended feed to either direct												
reduction or blast furnace operations.												
The testwork undertaken on the high and low sulfur ore types has demonstrated the metallurgy for												
both the Tapuli and Sahavaara deposits and the selected process route is considered by SRK to be												
appropriate for both.												
Sufficient engineering has been performed to establish the plant capital cost assuming a contingency												
of 10% and the implementation schedule and while the potential effect of weather windows on the												
"overall schedule should be reassessed if the project start date changes significantly, the construction"												
and plant ramp up time for both Tapuli and Sahavaara streams is considered realistic.												
Concentrate Transport												
"After reviewing various options of transporting and shipping of concentrates from Kaunisvaara, the"												
route selected by Northland is through the port of Narvik in Norway. This entails trucking the												
concentrate to link up with existing rail facilities at Svappavaara. There the concentrates will be												
stockpiled and loaded onto side tipping wagons by front end loader and transported to the port of												
"Fagernes in Narvik. In Narvik, the trains will be de-iced before being unloaded and the concentrates"												
stockpiled in a covered shed before being conveyed to a radial shiploader on a quay to be constructed.												
"In SRK’s opinion, the proposed method and route for the export of concentrates from Kaunisvaara to"												
the port of Narvik has been established in principle and in sufficient detail to determine the feasibility												
of the selected route and associated capital and operating costs.												
Northland is in negotiations to form a Joint Venture Company with interested parties involved in the												
development and running of the transport corridor from Kaunisvaara to Narvik for the export of												
concentrates. This Joint Venture Company will fund the development of the new facilities at												
Svappavaara and Narvik through a mix of equity and external financing. The road trucks and railway												
rolling stock will be leased to the Joint Venture Company for the duration of the venture.

The options selected have been developed to a reasonable degree of detail enabling an estimate to be												
produced that has a degree of confidence that is suitable for the DFS. The capital costs required for the												
infrastructure and the transportation of concentrates have been assessed in detail and where the designs												
are conceptual reasonable allowances have been made. The estimated cost is US$145m based on the												
Project exchange rate of SEK 8.125:US$1.00.												
Tailings/Waste Rock Management												
The Kaunisvaara Tailings Management Facility has been designed as a central thickened discharge												
facility to overcome the environmental constraints presented by the selected site for development. This												
design assumes the tailings will be discharged from the central portion of the facility towards the outer												
"perimeter. No water will be stored within the tailings portion of facility, with slurry water conveyed"												
directly to the clarification pond.												
The central discharge scheme could however involve different types of operational risks associated												
with winter operation. Notably:												
"•	Slumping may occur within particular sections of the tailings beach due to freeze/thaw cycles"												
throughout the year. This process will affect the overall beach angle resulting in reduced												
capacity for tails storage. Additional drainage structures at the base of the perimeter												
"embankment would negate this issue, as entrained water will be removed from the tailings"												
"during the operational phase, and if incorporated would have minimal impact upon the currently"												
forecast capital and operating expenditures;												
"•	There is a risk that the projected 4% tailings beach angle will not be achieved. If this is the case"												
the forecast operating costs would increase as higher containment embankments would be												
required.												
"•	There could be issues regarding water return to the clarification pond in winter months due to"												
freezing of the area conveying the water (ditches around the facility). While provisions for												
"winter water return will therefore need to be considered in more detail, SRK does not belive that"												
this will have any material implications for the envisaged capital expenditure.												
The primary waste rock dump storage facility comprises two dumps: one at Tapuli and one at												
Sahavaara. The engineering design and the preliminary capital cost estimate for the dumps has been												
"derived by SRK following a geotechnical site investigation, laboratory testing and stability analyses."												
The waste rock dump storage facility was designed as part of the October 2010 study and has not been												
"updated with recent changes to the mining schedule. That said, the current plan mines less waste than"												
the October 2010 study and as it stands the current waste rock dump design and capacity criteria are												
"therefore still valid and robust. Notwithstanding this, it is recognised that the waste rock dump storage"												
facility aspects of the study may benefit from an update to match the current mining schedule and that												
"this may result in certain cost savings. These are unlikely, however, to be material to the project as a"												
whole.												
"The total tonnage of the waste (soil and rock) to be stored, based on the October 2010 study was"												
calculated at 300Mt and 400Mt for the Tapuli and Sahavaara pits respectively. The recent update to												
the mining schedule shows that the total tonnage of (soil and rock) to be stored is calculated at 240Mt												
"and 303Mt for the Tapuli and Sahavaara pits, this being a reduction in 60Mt and 97Mt respectively."

The ongoing kinetic geochemical testing for the ARD potential of the waste rock will confirm the												
suitability of the Sahavaara closure encapsulation method. This data will be reviewed when available												
and incorporated at detailed design stage to ensure that the current design includes the latest testwork												
results.												
"The envisaged capital expenditure for dump development including peat stripping, excavation and"												
placement will require confirmation upon completion of negotiations with the contractors. The present												
unit costs used in the model were derived by Northland and are supported by real quotes from local												
contractors but are relatively low when compared to other similar projects.												
SRK has put forward specific monitoring measures to ensure peat deformation and slope failures are												
minimised throughout the operational phase of the dumps. These will need to be observed at all times												
to ensure that operations are not compromised by potential localised peat failures.												
Environmental Management												
Northland has undertaken a comprehensive environmental and social impact assessment process for												
both pits and the Kaunisvaara processing site and tailings storage facility. The ore transport option												
through the port of Narvik in Norway may require additional environmental and social impact												
assessments to be undertaken.												
No environmental and social fatal flaws have been identified but a number of issues exist that will												
"need to be evaluated proactively to ensure additional material costs are not incurred, in particular: the"												
acid rock drainage potential associated with some of the Sahavaara mine waste rock and tailings												
disposal; the impacts on ecologically protected areas; resettlement and land acquisition; changes to the												
transport option; and the relationships with the local Sami who are the Sameby concession holders.												
The necessary permits have either been obtained or there is a strategy in place to obtain these. There												
is a risk of the Sahavaara environmental permit application submission being delayed due to requests												
by the Environmental Court for reformatting the application in line with changes in permitting practice												
subsequent to the submittal of the application.												
Economic Modelling												
SRK has constructed a pre-tax and pre-finance Technical Economic Model (TEM) to derive a Net												
Present Value (NPV) for the Kaunisvaara project based on the technical assumptions developed as part												
of the Feasibility Study. This model currency is the US Dollar (USD) and any Swedish Krona (SEK)												
or Euro (EUR) derived costs have been converted at a SEK: USD exchange rate of 8.125:1 for												
operating costs and 6.57 for capital costs. A EUR:USD exchange rate of 0.7813:1 has been used for												
both capital and operating costs. In addition the model is based on a base case discount rate of 8%												
which starts in Q1 2010 and is presented in real 2010 terms.												
The forecast capital and operating costs incorporated into the TEM have been reviewed by SRK and												
accepted as being reasonable given the information currently available and in the context of the												
"Feasibility Study. The forecast operating costs total USD 3,491 million, including a 5% contingency"												
over the life of mine while the forecast capital costs total USD 899 million and include a 10%												
contingency.

The TEM currently assumes that the ore will be transported to the port of Narvik in Norway and that												
the capital costs associated with the development of the transport corridor involving road transport to												
Sappavaara and rail to the shiploading port at Narvik will be borne by a Joint Venture company												
involving Northland and two interested parties who are currenly negotiating their participation in the												
Joint Venture with Northland. It is anticipated that funding will come from JV equity of 30% and 70%												
from financing still to be arranged. The capital and operating costs have been estimated in detail. This												
"detail has been included in the current TEM where the cost per tonne for transport and shiploading,"												
"inclusive of capital, has been calculated. The rate per tonne for transportation of concentrates from"												
"Kaunisvaara to the ship at the port in Narvik amounts to US$26.4, but this does not include any"												
allowances for return on JV equity or JV profit as those are still subject to negotiation.												
"The resulting pre-tax, pre-finance NPV derived by SRKis USD 1 465 million, assuming an 8%"												
discount rate. SRK notes that this valuation is significantly higher than the previous Project valuation												
"of USD 770 million, as derived by SRK and presented in the technical report entitled “Technical"												
"Review of the Kaunisvaara iron project, Sweden”, dated 3 October, 2010. The principal reason for this"												
increased NPV can be attributed to substantially higher commodity price forecast data incorporated												
into the updated TEM. These price assumptions were developed by Northland on the basis of an												
independent third party report by Raw Materials Group and public domain dry bulk shipping cost												
forecast data.

TECHNICAL REVIEW OF THE KAUNISVAARA IRON												
"PROJECT, SWEDEN. JUNE 2011."												
Prepared under National Instrument 43-101												
and accompanying documents 43-101F1 and 43-101CP												
"1	INTRODUCTION"												
This technical report has been prepared for Northland Resources AB (Northland) by SRK												
Consulting (UK) Ltd (SRK) in connection with the publication by Northland of the												
Kaunisvaara Feasibility Study and Northland’s reporting requirements related to the Toronto												
Stock Exchange (TSX). Northland has been listed on the TSX since 2003 (as North												
American Gold) and is principally an iron exploration and development company with												
properties in northern Sweden and Finland.												
This report describes the results of an updated review of the Kaunisvaara Feasibility Study												
(the Feasibility Study) which comprises the exploitation of the Sahavaara and Tapuli iron												
ore projects in northern Sweden (the Mineral Assets). The original review had an effective												
date of 3 October 2010 while this update incorporates the results of amended concentrate												
"logistics studies undertaken by Northland and reviewed by SRK, updated reserve estimates"												
produced by SRK and an updated Technical Economic Model prepared by SRK which												
reflects all the changes made and revised iron ore price assumptions.												
SRK prepared the Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve estimates presented in the												
"Feasibility Study and provided direct geotechnical, hydrological, waste rock management"												
and Acid Rock Drainage inputs to the Tapuli and Sahavaara mine design assumed by this. In												
"preparing this report, SRK has in addition reviewed those aspects of the Feasibility Study"												
completed by Northland and its other contractors and consultants to a sufficient level to												
enable SRK to present its own opinions on the project and an audited NPV for this.												
The Kaunisvaara project is a development stage project which when constructed will												
comprise two conventional open pit mines and a magnetite processing operation producing a												
concentrate product.

The work undertaken by SRK in compiling this report has been managed by Mr Howard												
"Baker, a Principal Mining Geologist with SRK. Mr Baker is a Qualified Person (QP) as"												
"defined by the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (CIM) and outlined"												
in National Instrument 43-101 of the Canadian Securities Administrators (NI 43-101). An												
appropriate certificate for Mr Baker accompanies this report. Mr Baker was also responsible												
for the Mineral Resource Estimates undertaken for the Sahavaara and Tapuli iron ore												
"projects. As part of this work, SRK undertook a site visit and made first hand observations"												
of the core collection and logging procedures employed and reviewed all data available for												
the Sahavaara and Tapuli deposits.												
The Mineral Reserves and mine design work outlined in this report has been conducted by												
"Mr Chris Reardon, a Principal Mining Engineer with SRK. Mr Reardon is a Qualified"												
"Person (QP) as defined by the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum"												
"(CIM)	and	outlined	in National	Instrument	43-101	of the	Canadian	Securities"												
Administrators (NI 43-101). An appropriate certificate for Mr Reardon accompanies this												
report.												
The Metallurgical testwork and plant design review work in this report has been conducted												
"by Dr David Pattinson, a Principal Metallurgist with SRK. Dr Pattinson is a Qualified"												
"Person (QP) as defined by the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum"												
"(CIM)	and	outlined	in National	Instrument	43-101	of the	Canadian	Securities"												
Administrators (NI 43-101). An appropriate certificate for Dr Pattinson accompanies this												
report.												
Additional technical input provided by SRK to the Feasibility Study was carried out by												
SRK’s Mr Kris Czajewski and Mr Jamie Spiers who managed the Waste Rock Design												
"aspects of the study, SRK’s Mr Andrew Barnes and Mr Mathew Dey who managed the Acid"												
"Rock Drainage aspects of the study, SRK’s Mr Phillip Mohr who managed the Geotechnical"												
aspects of the study and SRK’s Mr James Bellin and My Tony Rex who managed the Mine												
Water Management aspects of the study.												
Review work of those aspects of the Feasibility Study not carried out by SRK was												
"undertaken by SRK’s Mr Kris Czajewski who reviewed the tailings aspects of the study,"												
"SRK’s Mr Colin Healy who reviewed the infrastructure aspects of the study, SRK’s Mrs"												
"Fiona Cessford who reviewed the environmental and permitting aspects of the study, and"												
SRK’s Mr Johan Bradley who reviewed financial modelling aspects of the study. All of												
these team members visited the site during 2009 and 2010 with Mr Colin Healy visiting the												
Northland logistics team in May 2011 and Mr Howard Baker and Mr Johan Bradley												
attending meetings with Northland personnel throughout 2011.												
"The work undertaken has all been reviewed by Dr Mike Armitage, the chairman of SRK."

"2	RELIANCE ON OTHER EXPERTS"												
Sections 3 to 13 of this report are mainly extracts from the Northland report entitled												
"Kaunisvaara Project - Preliminary Economic Assessment, dated 20 October 2009, which"												
was prepared by the author Thomas Lindholm of GeoVista AB on behalf of Northland. The												
opinions and conclusions presented in the Northland PEA report are based largely on												
"information and technical reports provided to the Author, Thomas Lindholm, by Northland"												
and its consultants. Some of the data used in the report were not within the control of the												
"Author or Northland. It is believed by the previous authors, that the information contained"												
herein is reliable under the conditions and subject to the qualifications set forth in the report.												
The additional information reviewed in preparing this report has largely been provided												
directly by Northland and its associated consultants. SRK conducted face to face meetings												
with those consultants responsible for the sections of the Feasibility Study not undertaken by												
"SRK. This included the process plant design undertaken by Jacobs, the infrastructure and"												
"utilities undertaken by Poyry and Jacobs, the metallurgy undertaken by Bo Arvidson"												
"Consulting, the tailings management undertaken by Poyry, the onsite and offsite"												
"infrastructure undertaken by Poyry and Jacobs, the concentrate transport and logistics"												
"undertaken by Poyry, the environmental and social impact assessment undertaken by"

"3	PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION"												
"The Kaunisvaara project comprises two iron ore deposits: Tapuli and Sahavaara, located"												
approximately 100 km north of the Arctic Circle in the municipality of Pajala and near the												
village of Kaunisvaara. Two elongated clusters of magnetite deposits occur in the Pajala and												
"Kolari Ore Districts, located in Sweden and Finland respectively (Figure 3-1). The two"												
"districts are located on either side of the Muoniojoki River, which marks the international"												
"boundary between the two countries. To date, as many as 30 magnetite deposits have been"												
"identified within an area of some 1,600 km2 (40 by 40 km), all located within Northland’s"												
exploration permit areas. Some of the major deposits in the vicinity of Pajala are shown in												
Figure 3-2 while the area covered by Northland's Swedish exploration permits is shown in												
Figure 3-3.												
The Sahavaara deposit is located close to the centre of the Kaunisvaara village. This has												
"been historically been referred to as ""Stora Sahavaara"", but given the use of the name “Sodra"												
"Sahavaara” for one of the mineralised lenses identified, Northland has now generalized the"												
name to simply Sahavaara. The Tapuli deposit is located approximately 4 km to the north of												
"Sahavaara. The Tapuli project comprises Palotieva at the northern extents, with Tapuli being"												
the southern extents and the majority of contained resources.												
Both Sahavaara and Tapuli are located within the Sahavaara No. 2 Exploration Permit.												
Tapuli is also covered by the Tapuli No. 1 and 2 Exploitation Concessions and Sahavaara is												
also covered by the Sahavaara No. 1 Exploitaion Concessions. The Sahavaara No. 2												
"Exploration Permit covers an area of some 16,456 hectares (Figure 3-3)."												
"By road, the town of Pajala is located approximately 210 km north of the major city of Lulea"												
"which has 70,000 inhabitants, and about 180 km from Rovaniemi in Finland which has"												
"40,000 inhabitants (see Figure 3-1). The project area can be located on topographic map"												
"Pajala 28M, 1:50,000 series."

"On December 8, 2004, Northland Resources Inc (formerly North American Gold Inc.)"												
announced that it had entered into a Letter of Agreement with Anglo American Exploration												
"B.V., Holland, Filial Sverige (Anglo), a wholly owned subsidiary of Anglo American"												
"Exploration plc, to acquire a 100 percent interest in the “Swedish Pajala Properties” also"												
referred to as the “Pajala Project” which includes the Tapuli and Sahavaara magnetite												
deposits. This Agreement was amended and the terms of the original agreement restated in												
"the “Option, Royalty and Back-In Agreement” (Agreement) dated April 5, 2005. During"												
"December of 2007, Northland exercised its option of cash payment for this agreement and"												
entered into an Offer to Purchase Agreement which allowed the company to negotiate final												
"terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement by January 31, 2008. The binding Asset Purchase"												
Agreement has been executed by both parties.												
There are four types of licence necessary to bring a mine from exploration to production in												
"Sweden. These are: exploration permits, followed by mining concessions (or exploitation"												
"licences), environmental permits (for rights to water supply and waste management), and"												
building permits (for building infrastructure).												
The exploration permits and exploitation licences that cover the Kaunisvaara project area are												
"100% owned by Northland Exploration Sweden AB or Northland Resources AB, both being"												
wholly-owned subsidiaries of Northland Resources Inc of Canada.

Any work in the concession area that might damage or disturb nature and/or people needs to												
be described in a valid work plan. Northland has prepared extensive plans for each												
concession which cover most of the routine work. Off-road permits are also needed for use												
of ski-doos and other field vehicles.												
"If the mine is opened, the landowner and the state are entitled to a mineral compensation,"												
which comprises 0.2% of the estimated value of the mined mineral over each year calculated												
"based on the quantity of ore mined, the percentage of mineral in the ore and the average"												
commodity price during the year. One quarter of this 0.2% goes to state and three quarters												
goes to the landowner.												
"SRK is not aware of any other royalties, back-in-rights, payments or any other agreements"												
associated with the Kaunisvaara project. Any future payments will be negotiated at the												
commencement of mining activity. SRK is not aware of any environmental liabilities												
associated with the Kaunisvaara project.

INFRASTRUCTURE AND PHYSIOGRAPHY												
"The airport of Pajala has several scheduled daily domestic flights to and from Lulea, the"												
"nearest airport to provide daily flights from Stockholm. By road, the distance from Lulea to"												
Pajala is 207 km and it takes just over two hours to drive by car. Pajala’s airport is located												
13 km west of the town and has a local commuter service.												
"Due to the proximity of the project to the international border with Finland, international"												
access is also available through Helsinki. There are several daily scheduled flights from												
Helsinki to Rovaniemi and Kittila. The town of Kolari is 167 km by road northwest of												
Rovaniemi and approximately 60 km west of Kittila. The centre of the Kaunisvaara Project												
"is located approximately 40 km west-southwest of Kolari. Furthermore, the project-area is"												
50 km southwest of the old iron ore mines of Rautuvaara (open pit and underground) and												
"Hannukainen (two open-pits), (see Figure 3-1)."												
"Access from Lulea is possible by following the E4 coastal road 55 km to Tore, turning north"												
on the E10 and by following this for another 50 km to Overkalix before turning right on the												
392 north to Pajala for another 105 km.												
Access from Rovaniemi can be gained by driving on Route 79 for 21 km at which point												
"there is a turn off on Route 83 at Sinetti to Pello, which is 98 km from Rovaniemi. At Pello,"												
the international border is crossed into Sweden. Taking Route 402 west for 5 km and then												
Route 99 north for a distance of 52 km the town of Pajala is reached.												
"Access to Sahavaara is reached by following Route 99 north from Pajala, turning right after"												
"8 km, crossing Tornealven (the Torne River) in the direction of Karesuando and then turning"												
off some 22 km from the bridge onto a dirt road. This dirt road services the small settlement												
of Sahavaara (Kaunisvaara South) on the southern flank of the Sahavaara deposit. The												
magnetite deposit runs north-northeast along the eastern flank of the hill. Sahavaara is												
"accessible all year since it is located on the slope of a hill, elevated above the wettest areas"												
of the swamp.												
"Access to Tapuli is reached by following Route 99 further north from Sahavaara, some 3 km"												
from Kaunisvaara and by turning left on the newly-constructed Tapuli Road at a point												
approximately 6 km south of the Finnish border. The magnetite deposits are situated near												
"the end of this road, approximately 2.5 km west of the Route 99 highway. The road crosses"												
the North Tapuli magnetite deposit and ends at partly wooded bog land just north of the												
main Central Tapuli deposit.												
The landscape was sculpted by extensive glaciers to form shallow lakes and extensive boggy												
"lowlands during the most recent ice age, spanning a period of between three and ten"												
"thousand years ago. Broad valleys were scoured out in the direction of glacial transport,"												
flanking low-lying hills underlain by resistant rocks. The landscape is now dominated by												
low rolling hills and flat lowlands comprised of bogs and lakes. The hills are mostly covered												
"by glacial moraine and sands and forest, primarily birch, pine, and spruce. The bedrock"												
"outcrops on the hills and along the riverbanks, but covers only some two percent or less of"												
the project area. The magnetite bodies of the Kaunisvaara Field are located in a region of

"According to Koppen’s climate classification, Northern Sweden belongs wholly to the"												
"temperate coniferous-mixed forest zone with cold, wet winters, where the mean temperature"												
of the warmest month is no lower than 10°C and that of the coldest month no higher than												
"minus 3°C, and where the rainfall is, on average, moderate in all seasons."												
The climate is typical of Northern Fennoscandia with temperate summers and cold winters.												
"During the summer months (June-August) temperatures are mostly between 10°C and 25°C,"												
and during the winter months (November-April) between -5°C and -30°C. Snow covers the												
terrain for an average of 183 days in the year with a maximum snow thickness varying from												
"0.6 to 1.2 m in March. Bogs, lakes and rivers are frozen for four to five months of the year."												
Annual rainfall is around 530 mm with a monthly range between 72 mm and 189 mm falling												
as snow during the winter months and accumulating on the ground. The midnight sun can be												
seen from 6 June to 7 July.												
Exploration work can be conducted during the winter by taking advantage of the frozen bogs												
"for access. If the project goes into operation, it should be able to operate throughout the"												
entire year.

The main influence on Northern Sweden’s climate is its arctic location between the 60th and												
70th northern parallels located in the Eurasian continent’s coastal zone. This region has												
characteristics of both maritime and continental climate depending on the direction of												
"airflow. When westerly winds prevail, the weather is warm and clear due to the airflows"												
"from the Atlantic Gulf Stream. When airflow is from the east, the Asian continental climate"												
prevails resulting in severe cold in winter and extreme heat in summer. The mean												
temperature in Northern Sweden is several degrees higher than that of other areas in these												
latitudes such as Siberia and southern Greenland due to the moderating effect of the Atlantic												
Ocean and the Baltic Sea.												
"Weather patterns in the project area and in the general region can change quite rapidly,"												
"particularly in winter, because Northern Sweden is located in a zone of prevailing westerly"												
winds where cooling sub tropical and polar air masses collide. The weather systems known												
to have the greatest influence on the climate are the low-pressure systems originating near												
Iceland and the high-pressure systems drifting in from Siberia and the Azores.												
The Kaunisvaara project is located some 120 km east of the Kiruna-Malmberget iron-mining												
"district, which is owned and operated by Luossavaara-Kiirunavaara Aktiebolag (LKAB), an"												
international high-technology minerals group (Figure 4-5). The distances to the deep-water												
ports of Lulea in Sweden and Narvik in Norway are 210 and 270 km respectively and both												
service the shipment of iron ore from Kiruna and Malmberget. The closest major ports in												
"Finland are Tornio and Kemi, some 180 and 200 km south of Pajala respectively."												
The town of Rovaniemi in Finland is located 150 km southeast of Pajala. Rovaniemi has												
"some 40,000 inhabitants and is the administrative centre of Finnish Lappland. A regional"												
technical centre of the Geological Survey of Finland (GTK) and an analytical laboratory are												
located in Rovaniemi.												
Northland has established a regional office in Lulea to facilitate the increasing number of												
professional staff now present preparing for mining production investigations.												
The towns of Pajala in Sweden and Kolari in Finland provide most of the exploration												
support services for the Kaunisvaara Project. Pajala is a community with a population of												
"7,900, of which some 2,200 are living in the central community. Kolari is a town of similar"												
size and has historically been a mining community serving the old iron mines at												
Hannukainen and Rautuvaara. The regional industrial base is now dominated by small												
"businesses involved in forestry, agriculture and manufacturing. There are also several hotels,"												
"shops, and restaurants which accommodate a growing year-round influx of tourists into"												
Lapland. A skilled work force is in place and the Swedish University System is represented												
in the town of Pajala. Northland maintains field offices in Pajala as well as in Kolari.

Hydroelectric power in the region is relatively inexpensive for commercial use. High-												
voltage electrical power is available from the main line located three km east of the project-												
"area. A railhead is located 20 km northeast at Akasjokisuu, Finland. This rail line is"												
designed for heavy commercial use and has been used to transport iron ore products and												
cement to the south of Finland. Currently the line is operational from Kolari southward												
connecting to the Finnish rail system. There is also a disused spur leading north from Kolari												
to a railhead at the Rautuvaara underground mine. Until the mid 1990s iron concentrates												
"were transported 350 km by rail to Rautaruukki Oy’s iron smelter at Raahe, which is 60 km"												
southwest of Oulu. The copper concentrate from Rautuvaara was transported down to												
Harjavalta smelter at Pori some 750 km south of Kolari. The Outokumpu Oy stainless steel												
smelter is located 170 km by rail south of Kolari.

"For the purposes of the Feasibility Study, all surface rights are covered by the exploration"

"5.1	Overview"												
What has been more recently been referred to informally as the Pajala Ironstone Belt was												
historically referred to in geological literature as the Kaunisvaara Iron Ore Field. During the												
"seventeenth century, iron ore from mines in Northern Sweden was used as feed for the"												
"Kengis foundry built in Pajala during 1641, which was the northernmost metallurgical"												
centre at the time. A smelting-works and a helve hammer were located at Kengis operating												
under the name Kengisverken and subsequently played an integral role in development of												
the settlement over the following two centuries.												
"Prospecting over an area northeast of Pajala in the province of Norbotten in 1918, a"												
"geologist, V Tanner, discovered five “ironstone” or magnetite deposits using a dip needle"												
"along the northern end of the Kaunisvaara Iron Ore Field (Lundberg, 1967). From north to"												
"south these were termed the Palotieva, Tapuli, Stora, Ostra and Sodra Sahavaara ironstone"												
occurrences (Figure 5-1).												
"During the 1940s, Boliden AB discovered the Ruutijarvi ironstone occurrence. The then"												
Swedish Geological Survey (SGU) is later credited with discovering a faulted extension of												
"Ruutijarvi called “Blind Ruutijarvi”. In 1958, the SGU, led by prospectors from the Johnson"												
"Company, discovered the Karhujarvi and Suksivuoma magnetite deposits, also located in the"												
Kaunisvaara Iron Ore Field.												
"In the 1960s the SGU, with funding and technical assistance from LKAB, began the Iron"												
Ore Inventory Program in the province of Norbotten as part of which ground magnetic and												
gravity surveys were conducted over the northern portion of the Kaunisvaara Field focusing												
on Tapuli and Stora Sahavaara. Diamond drilling commenced in 1961 on the Sahavaara												
"occurrences and throughout the early 1960s exploration of Stora Sahavaara progressed,"												
leading to the delineation of a resource. During the latter part of the 1960s exploration												
"focused on the Tapuli deposit, leading to the delineation of an additional resource. Table 5-1"												
summarises information relating to previous drilling of the Pajala iron occurrences.

Past exploration by the SGU resulted in the delineation of several magnetite resources												
"within the Sahavaara No. 2 permit area, shown in Figure 3-3. These historic resource"												
estimates were produced several decades ago and therefore do not comply with more recent												
definitions and guidelines for the reporting and disclosure of resources. Furthermore the												
resources are uncategorized and unverifiable without further extensive work.

"By 2006, in excess of 120 drillholes for a total amount of 28,000 m had been drilled to"												
explore the various magnetite occurrences within the Kaunisvaara Field in Sweden. The												
current total after the completion of the 2009 drilling programme is 385 drillholes for a total												
"of 66,283 m. The Ore Field hosts ten different magnetite occurrences with non-43-101"												
compliant historic resource estimates. SRK can not verifying these estimates or comment on												
their validity and has not therefore presented these in this report.												
LKAB explored and conducted a limited drilling programme in the Liviovaara and												
Sahavaara Nr. 3 areas from 1984 to 1986 for iron oxide-copper-gold (IOCG) potential away												
from the known magnetite deposits. The Finnish mining company Outokumpu also explored												
and evaluated portions of the same area for IOCG potential in the mid-1990s.												
Anglo American Exploration (Anglo) targeted the Pajala ironstone belt because its												
geophysical signature and tectonic setting were generally similar to other known IOCG												
occurrences in the world. Anglo started exploration in 2000 with a GeoTem survey flown												
"over parts of the current licence areas. The results from this survey, together with the"												
"magnetic characteristics of the area, formed the basis for the exploration program conducted"												
by Anglo during 2000 to 2004.												
"In 2004, Northland entered into an Agreement with Anglo previously described in detail in"												
"the Tapuli Resource Report by GeoVista AB and Micon International Co Ltd, 2009 and has"												
been actively exploring since this time.												
"5.2	Previous Mapping and Surface Sampling"												
"Fredrik Ros, former geologist at the SGU, produced thorough geologic maps of the area and"												
"described the general character of the stratigraphy, structure, geophysics and resources of"												
the Pellivuoma magnetite deposit in detail (Ros 1980). The geologic mapping of the SGU												
"has since then been updated by Witschard (1984, 1986) and this work forms the basis of the"												
published SGU geologic map of the area.												
"After the initial discovery of the Kaunisvaara Ore Field in 1918, a magnetic-based"												
geological map of the area was produced. The magnetite occurrences of the Kaunisvaara												
Ore Field have since been described and researched in numerous geologic investigations by												
"the SGU (Eriksson 1955, Fredrikson 1986, Frietsch 1957, 1962, 1962, Hanson 1984)."												
"5.3	Previous Geochemical Surveys"												
"5.3.1	SGU/LKAB Geochemical Surveys"												
Bergstrom conducted a regional heavy-mineral stream-sediment sampling program during												
"1973 and 1974, resulting in published maps showing concentrations of W, Cr and P2O5"												
(Bergstrom 1975). Follow-up stream-sediment and peat sampling was done by Magnusson												
(1984) who created a statistical evaluation of the data from the Pajala area. Ronkko (1985)												
"created a map, compiling all of the previous peat and stream sampling at a scale of 1:50,000"												
"displaying Cu-Mo, Pb-Zn, Co-Ni and Fe-Mn concentrations."

Boulder and base of till sampling on a regional-scale by Hanson (1984) focused on the												
Pajala district. Nilsson (1991) expanded this work with till sampling in the Pajala area and												
further south producing a set of maps showing concentrations of 20 different elements.												
"During 1984-1986, peat and base of till surveys were conducted over the Liviovaara"												
prospect by LKAB (van der Stijl 2005a).												
The magnetite iron ores have been tested for specific elements in two different studies.												
Danielsson (1982) tested samples from Tapuli and Stora Sahavaara for cobalt but found no												
anomalous results. L. Carlson and his colleagues tested seven iron occurrences for gold and												
found that samples from Tapuli produced anomalous results (L. Carlson 1982).												
"5.3.2	Anglo American Exploration Geochemical Surveys"												
Detailed base of till sampling was carried out on six different grids during 2000 to 2004 (van												
"der Stijl 2005b). Anglo American collected 1,669 base of till samples from the five grids at"												
"the Palotieva (three grids), Liviovaara, Jupukka and Suksivuoma prospects (Figure 5-1)."												
Inspection of the results of geochemical sampling (383 samples) at Palotieva identified a												
linear Cu anomaly of moderate intensity (up to 0.54% Cu and 176 ppb Au) over												
"approximately 2,000 m of strike length. More recently a single line, 140 m in length of"												
detailed samples (2.5 m spacing) were later assayed by Anglo American and found to												
contain a 20 m section averaging 4.6% Cu and 0.9 g/t Au in bedrock from below the base of												
till samples. The Palotieva grids are located approximately 1 km northeast of Tapuli.												
The Suksivuoma grid is approximately 5 km south of Sahavaara where 510 base of till												
samples were collected at a spacing of 50 to 100 m. Geochemical results at Suksivuoma												
indicated a number of significant but dispersed copper-gold anomalies (up to 0.5% Cu and												
"1.6 ppm Au). At Jupukka, 10 km south, 506 samples were collected which outlined a"												
geochemical anomaly of high copper and gold values in basal-till samples (up to 0.4% Cu												
and 105 ppb Au). The Liviovaara grid is located approximately 18 km south of Sahavaara.												
"Geochemical results from 270 samples showed a significant, nearly 500 by 200 m wide"												
"basal till copper-gold-uranium geochemical anomaly (with up to 0.14% Cu, 92 ppb Au, and"												
83 ppm U).												
"5.4	Previous Geophysical Surveys"												
"5.4.1	SGU/LKAB Geophysical Surveys"												
"As a consequence of the lack of significant outcrops in the area, and the thick glacial till"												
cover; magnetic surveys are generally a more effective means of locating magnetite												
occurrences than traditional prospecting. A typical approach taken in surveying has been to												
carry out an initial overview using airborne surveys followed up by more detailed ground-												
based surveying. Gravity measurements have been taken over some of the occurrences to												
form a basis for the down dip projection of the magnetite mineralisation.												
Airborne magnetometer surveying in the late 1940s by Boliden AB detected mineralisation												
"at Ruutijarvi. In 1958, Rederi AB Nordstjernan used the same method to discover the"												
"Suksivuoma mineralisation (Frietsch, 1997)."

"At Sahavaara, there has been no ground-based magnetic survey carried out since 1960 when"												
a torsion magnetometer was used as an exploration tool. The grid covered 1.4 km2 with												
"100 m line spacing and 20-40 m between stations. At this time, gravimetric surveys were"												
also conducted along several cross lines to assess the strike of the magnetite body												
"(Lundberg, 1965)."												
"Between 1963 and 1965, ground-based magnetic and gravity surveys were conducted over"												
"the Pellivuoma, Tapuli, Palotieva, Suksivuoma, and Ruutijarvi, ironstone occurrences"												
(Figure 5-1). Magnetic surveys using Askania Gfz magnetometers were taken at 20 by 80 m												
"grid stations covering 42.2 km2. Gravimetric surveys were undertaken using Worden,"												
Pioneer and Prospector type gravimeters. This data was collected on 400 to 800 m line												
"spacing on 40 m centres (Lindroos, 1972). In the published report (Tapuli och Palotieva"												
"Jarnmalmsfyndighet, Hardy Lindroos, Bjorn Nylund, Kjell I Johansson, SGU 1972) it was"												
concluded that interpretation of the combined magnetics and gravity indicated that the												
"central iron deposit at Sahavaara may be continuous to a depth in excess of 2,000 m."												
"At Liviovaara, LKAB conducted magnetic and Slingram EM surveys during the period,"												
"1984-1986 (van der Stijl, 2005a)."												
"Lindberg (1990) used digital imaging to analyze airborne magnetic, Slingram and gravity"												
data for the Pajala district which resulted in identification of 65 target-areas and												
recommendations for follow up ground-based magnetic surveys.												
"5.4.2	Anglo American Exploration Geophysical Surveys"												
Between 2000 and 2004 Anglo conducted geophysical surveys on six separate grids												
covering approximately a total of 22.25 km2. Ground magnetometer (12.5 m stations) and												
"TEM surveys were conducted on grids at Palotieva (7 km2), Suksivuoma (6.25 km2),"												
"Jupukka, (6 km2) and Liviovaara, (3 km2). At Liviovaara, five lines 100 m apart were"												
"surveyed by IP with 25 m dipole spacing. At Palotieva, a GEOTEM airborne survey was"												
"also competed. In each of these areas, the ground magnetometry surveys delineated strong to"												
"moderate, linear anomalies. The TEM surveys produced local anomalies on all of the grids"												
surveyed except for Liviovaara. The GEOTEM survey at Palotieva highlighted the same												
anomalies as seen in the ground based TEM survey.												
"5.4.3	Northland Airborne Exploration Geophysical Survey"												
"Under contract to Northland, the Geological Survey of Finland (GTK) performed a detailed"												
"airborne geophysical survey of the Pajala area in August, 2006. The GTK survey was"												
"conducted with a four frequency EM system, a total field magnetometer, and a gamma ray"												
"spectrometer. Hans Thunehed, GeoVista AB, prepared a report “Interpretation of"												
geophysical data from the Pajala area” for Northland on 16 August 2007 to identify												
anomalous areas for further investigation and possible drill testing.

"The geophysical signature of a few known deposits (for example, Sahavaara, Tapuli) in the"												
"area was first investigated. The magnetite deposits at Tapuli, Sahavaara, and Palotieva were"												
"shown to be reasonably good electric conductors, but were by far not as good conductors as"												
"the abundant graphite bearing rocks of the area. Not surprisingly, the magnetite deposits"												
were also found to be strongly magnetic. The graphitic rocks were found in both low-												
magnetic and highly-magnetic formations. Potentially economic mineralisation is known to												
occur within or adjacent to the graphite bearing formations and local variations in the												
"geophysical character of these rocks was part of the study; for example, to look for places"												
with favourable structural/tectonic settings and for locations where the general pattern in												
conductive or magnetic rocks has been disrupted.												
"To that end, the investigation also included a regional tectonic interpretation because the"												
structural/tectonic setting is a significant parameter in the definition of targets. A mosaic of												
"magnetic data from the GTK survey, SGU airborne data from the Norbotten exploration"												
"package, and GTK data from the neighbouring map-sheets on the Finnish side was made."												
Structural trends and major lineaments were interpreted and several N-S to SW-NE trending												
shear zones were identified. A number of splays (and possibly Riedel-structures) to these												
zones were also identified. There is also a number of S-shaped fold structures. Both the												
interpreted splays and the folds indicate a sinistral (counter-clockwise) ductile to brittle-												
ductile shearing of the area.												
"5.5	Drilling by Previous Explorers"												
Initial resource delineation drilling commenced at Sahavaara in 1960 and continued for five												
"years, during which time 46 drillholes were completed for 11,798 m. Drilling by the SGU in"												
"the 1970s increased the number of drillholes to 50 for a total of 12,018 m (Figure 5-2)."												
"Northland’s historic drilling database has been compiled from two primary references, both"												
relating to the drilling of the SGU at Sahavaara. Copies of the original drill logs and assay												
"files from 63 drillholes, 50 from Stora Sahavaara and 13 from Sodra (South) Sahavaara were"												
obtained from the SGU regional office in Mala. The SGU report “Stora Sahavaara Iron Ore												
Occurrence” by Bo Lundberg (1965a) was obtained on loan from the SGU office in Mala.												
"This report is in two volumes, the first is a written description of the deposit and the second"												
is a large format book with reprints of the original map and drill profile cross-sections. A												
"topographic map containing Stora Sahavaara drill collars, roads, local grid and UTM grid"												
was also obtained from the SGU in Mala.

"5.6	2006 Sahavaara Historic Mineral Resource Estimate"												
A Mineral Resource Estimate for the Sahavaara iron deposit was prepared by Dr Bart												
Stryhas in 2006 as an independent consultant to Northland. This was subsequently adopted												
"by Chlumsky, Armbrust and Meyer, LLC (CAM) and presented in the “Technical Report,"												
"Sahavaara Project, Northern Sweden”, CAM, 29 June 2006 which was filed with the System"												
for Electronic Document Analysis and Retrieval (SEDAR) on 4 July 2006. The estimate												
was based on 60 drillholes incorporating 46 historical holes and 16 holes drilled by												
"Northland. In SRK’s opinion this mineral resource, which was reported using the 43-101"												
"guidelines, appears to be a valid and reliable estimate."												
"CAM, using MineSight® software, constructed a wireframe of the Sahavaara mineralisation"												
units initially through cross section interpretations of lithological boundaries and a cut-off												
grade of 25% Fe. The use of a 25% Fe cut-off grade satisfied CAM in terms of grade												
distribution curves and on the operating grade which LKAB was applying at the												
geologically similar Malmberget Mine in September 2005.												
"At the southern end of the deposit, CAM modelled a small magnetite lens located in the"												
footwall of the main body (Sodra); both bodies have been used in the resource estimate.												
"The Sahavaara resources estimated by CAM are based on 60 drillholes totalling 14,222 m."												
Specific gravity values for each block within the model were calculated based on the grade-												
density relationships derived from historical density sample results.

"Measured Resources to those blocks that are estimated within a 38 m search radius, whilst"												
resource blocks estimated within a 75 m radius yet not falling into the Measured category												
were classed as Indicated. A search rectangle (70 x 200 x 150 m) was used to classify												
Inferred resources.

A historic Mineral Resource Estimate for the Tapuli iron deposit was prepared by Thomas												
Lindholm and Dibya Kanti Mukhopadhyay in 2008 as independent consultants to Northland.												
This was subsequently adopted by GeoVista AB (GeoVista) and presented in the “Tapuli												
Resource Estimate” and filed with the System for Electronic Document Analysis and												
Retrieval (SEDAR) on 23 January 2009. This estimate was based on 130 drillholes												
incorporating 24 historical holes and 106 holes drilled by Northland. This estimate was												
reported according to NI 43-101 guidelines and definitions with the resources being												
"classified into Measured, Indicated and Inferred categories. SRK considers this to be a valid"												
and reliable estimate.

"24,475 m. Specific gravity values for each block within the model were calculated based on"												
the grade-density relationships derived from historical density sample results.												
"The resources were classified as Measured, Indicated and Inferred, and GeoVista reports the"												
resources at a 15% Fe cut-off grade); see Table 5-3.												
"The classification criteria applied by GeoVista are listed below, they were reported in"												
accordance with the 43-101 instrument.												
Measured Mineral Resources were defined as those portions of the mineralised area which												
had been drilled generally on a grid of 50 X 50 m. The blocks were estimated with a												
"minimum of 8 samples, utilising a maximum of six samples from one drillhole."												
Indicated Mineral Resources were defined as those portions of the mineralised area which												
were generally drilled on a grid of 100 X 100 m. The blocks were estimated with a												
"minimum of three samples, utilising a maximum of two samples from a drillhole."												
Inferred Mineral Resources were defined as those portions of the mineralised area which												
"were found outside of the indicated, but still within the interpreted mineralised envelopes,"												
with drill spacing greater than 100 X 100 m.												
"In total, GeoVista reported the iron ore resource at Tapuli to be 103.9 Mt at a mean grade of"

"The Fennoscandian Shield is the largest exposed Precambrian crustal domain in Europe,"												
covering most of Finland and Sweden as well as significant parts of Northwestern Russia.												
The bedrock of the northern part of the Fennoscandian shield consists of an Archaean												
granitoid-gneiss basement which is unconformably overlain by Paleoproterozoic												
supracrustal sequences. The latter consist of Karelian (2.5 -2.0 Ga) greenstones and related												
sedimentary rocks and Svecofennian (1.96-1.85 Ga) successions which together represent												
"ancient rift, island arc, continental-margin and continent-continent tectono-magmatic"												
systems. The Karelian sequence consists of komatiitic to tholeiitic metavolcanic rocks with												
terrestrial to shallow marine metasedimentary rock intercalations. Terrestrial sedimentary												
units with minor felsic volcanic rocks comprise the Svecofennian sequence in the east												
(Finland). In the west (Sweden) abundant felsic metavolcanic rocks accompany the												
"sedimentary rocks of the Svecofennian sequence (Figure 6-1) (Kaunisvaara PEA, 2009)."												
The intrusives in the northern part of the Fennoscandian Shield consist of 2.5-2.44 Ga mafic												
"layered intrusions, 2.2 to 2.05 Ga mafic dykes and sills, voluminous 1.88 to 1.86 Ga mafic"												
"to felsic calc-alkaline syn-orogenic intrusions, ca. 1.80 Ga late-orogenic granitoids, and"												
"post-orogenic ca. 1.77 Ga granitic intrusions (Kaunisvaara PEA, 2009)."												
"The supracrustal sequences and all other rock-types, except the ca. 1.77 Ga granites, were"												
multiply deformed and metamorphosed during the Svecofennian orogenic events between												
"1.98 and 1.79 Ga. Several crustal-scale structures are known in the area, one of which is the"												
NNE-SSW striking Pajala Shear Zone (PSZ) which straddles the border between Finland												
and Sweden. The PSZ is up to 50 km wide and at least 150 km long and is a crustal-scale												
shear zone system that outlines the boundary between Norbotten craton in the west and												
"Karelian craton in the East (for example, Lahtinen et al, 2005). This boundary can be"												
followed by structural features in bedrock exposures and as an area of steep gravity gradient												
in geophysical maps. The structural lineaments that comprise the PSZ were initially formed												
during the continent-continent collision of the Norbotten and Karelian cratons in 1.89-												
1.86 Ga and were subsequently (re-)activated during later orogenic events between 1.83 and												
"1.79 Ga (for example, Lahtinen et al, 2005; Niiranen et al, 2006; Holtta et al, 2007)."												
The peak metamorphic conditions in the northern Fennoscandian shield vary between												
"greenschist and granulite facies conditions (Holtta et al, 2007). Three different ductile"												
deformation stages (D1-D3) and subsequent brittle stages have been detected in the region.

The generalized bedrock geology of the Sahavaara and Tapuli deposits is shown in Figure												
6-4. The mineralised zone and adjacent wall rocks contain abundant faults ranging in width												
"from 1 to 20 m. Contacts between the host rocks, skarn and mineralisation are"												
"predominantly tectonic. There are two preferred fault orientations, the first parallel to the"												
NNE-SSW striking metamorphic foliation and a second which strikes NW-SE with steep to												
"moderate dips (Lindroos, 1974). The fault zone fabrics typically consist of clast-supported to"												
matrix-supported breccias. Many of the faults in the skarn zone are associated with clay												
alteration including kaolin. Thin calcite veins are common throughout the deposit.

"6.3.1	Sahavaara Deposit Geology"												
The Sahavaara deposit occurs as a continuous “seam” located between a hanging-wall												
quartzite and footwall graphitic schist. Minor remnants of skarn-altered dolomite occur												
within the deposit and likely reflect the original protolith. The bulk of the mineralisation												
consists of a magnetite body with elevated copper concentrations. The magnetite deposit has												
"been delineated at surface over a strike of 1,300 m with an average true width of 52 m"												
"(Figure 6-5). Down dip at a distance of 250 m, the deposit has been traced for 1000 m along"												
"strike with an average true width of 48 m. At a down-dip distance of 550 m, the deposit has"												
been traced for 600 m along strike with an average width of 43 m.												
The Sahavaara mineralised zone is enveloped by three types of skarns. Serpentine skarns												
"and clinopyroxene-amphibole and are the most abundant in comparison to a scapolite skarn,"												
which has also developed. The clinopyroxene-amphibole skarn is composed mostly of equal												
"proportions of tremolite and diopside with small amounts of scapolite, magnetite and garnet."												
Development of the clinopyroxene-amphibole skarn is mostly confined to the hanging wall												
of the magnetite body and is locally observed as intercalations within the core of the												
magnetite mineralisation. The serpentine skarn is common in both the hanging wall and												
footwall of the magnetite body and consists dominantly of very fine-grained serpentine with												
"varying amounts of magnetite, chlorite, talc and calcite. The scapolite skarn occurs mainly"												
in the footwall side of the magnetite body but can be locally observed in the hanging wall												
consisting dominantly of fine to medium-grained scapolite with varying amounts of diopside												
and tremolite. The hanging wall to the west of the mineralisation consists of a sedimentary												
"unit consisting of graphitic phyllite, quartzitic-phyllite, and quartzite (Figure 6-5)."												
"Centimetre-scale, tight to isoclinal folding is typical in the hanging wall phyllite and"												
footwall graphitic schist. Closer to the mineralisation the amount of quartz increases as												
feldspar and biotite decrease in abundance. The immediate wall rock next to the skarn-zone												
"is typically a fine-grained quartzite with small amounts of biotite. The footwall rock,"												
"immediately below the skarn unit, is a graphitic schist consisting of fine-grained quartz,"												
"scapolite, graphite, biotite, and tremolite. This unit is rich in pyrrhotite and lesser amounts of"												
"pyrite with some local chalcopyrite mineralisation. East of the graphitic schist, a 150 to"												
200 m thick unit of phyllite contains a 30 to 40 m wide intercalation of dolomitic marble.												
The lowest unit in the stratigraphic sequence is a mafic metavolcanic rock. Meta-diabase												
"dykes are abundant throughout the mineralised sequence. Typically, the dykes are less than"												
a few metres thick but locally they can range up to 15 m thick. The dykes occur parallel to												
the NW-SE oriented faults and shears and they crosscut both the skarn and the magnetite												
mineralisation as well as the Lina Suite granites (1.82-1.79 Ga) peripheral to the deposit												
"(Lindroos, 1974). The dykes are consistently altered forming scapolite- or K-feldspar"												
"(Lundberg, 1967)."

"6.3.2	Tapuli Deposit Geology"												
The bedrock at Tapuli consists of Precambrian supracrustal sedimentary sequences. The												
generalized surface geology at Tapuli and cross section across the Central Tapuli deposit is												
shown in Figure 6-6 and Figure 6-7. The Tapuli mineralised lenses follow a stratigraphic												
"corridor approximately 2 km long. The deposit occurs as set of strata-bound, semi-"												
"continuous, tabular bodies. The mineralisation in the central portion of the trend is by far the"												
"most economically important in terms of its size, grade, and continuity. This is shown in"												
Figure 6-6.

The deposit has been outlined by drilling to depths ranging from the surface to 300 m below												
"surface, with bands of contiguous magnetite mineralisation with variable iron grades ranging"												
from 10 to 200 m in thickness. The mineralisation remains open down-dip below the limits												
of the resource and the vertical extent of the deposits is not delineated.												
The dip of the mineralised lenses is concordant with the surrounding metasedimentary units												
"and ranges from 45 to 60 degrees, the main dip direction varying between WNW to NW."												
"The Tapuli magnetite deposit occurs as a relatively continuous mineralised trend, with"												
"occasional moderate displacements by crosscutting, sub-vertical faults. core breakage and"												
crushing within the mineralised zones and wall rocks provide evidence of faulting.												
Interpretation of magnetic signatures and the close-spaced drillhole spacing has provided												
clear evidence of discontinuity offsets in most cases. Several north- and northwest-trending												
faults are apparent from the stratigraphic and mineralisation displacements.												
"The Tapuli deposit is situated within the northwestern limb of a major, NE-trending"												
anticline within the supracrustal rocks and on the westernmost margin of the PSZ.												
"Structurally, Tapuli is situated in the same NE-SW trending shear zone as at Sahavaara. The"												
"main central portion of the deposit, and thickest part of the deposit (up to 200 m), was"												
formed along a significant NE-trending flexure in the major fold axis.												
A phyllite unit with interbedded graphitic phyllite beds is located at the bottom of the Tapuli												
stratigraphy. Minor horizons of dolomite and skarn were also apparent within this unit in a												
few of the deeper SGU holes. A Karelian dolomitic marble is situated above the phyllites												
and the bulk of the mineralisation and skarn varieties overprint the dolomite. Occasional												
"rafts of dolomitic marble, typically less than a few metres thick, are found surrounded by"												
mineralisation. The phyllite usually is present as the footwall to the magnetite bodies and												
"skarn horizons. The dolomite and mineralisation are consistently 250 to 350 m thick, and"												
"generally where the magnetite deposits are thick, the dolomite is thin and vice versa."												
"The hanging wall to the west of the mineralsation is a layered sedimentary unit of phyllite,"												
"quartzitic phyllite, and quartzite, or their metamorphic equivalents (mica schist and biotite"												
"gneiss). This unit is well-bedded, exhibiting sedimentary structures."												
"Mafic dykes or sills are common throughout the stratigraphy, and are typically less than a"												
few metres thick. The mafic rocks are present in both the skarn and magnetite mineralisation												
as well as the country rocks and are variably scapolite-altered.												
The magnetite mineralisation is enveloped by metasomatic skarns. The alteration is												
dominated by skarn assemblages that can be divided into following types: •												
"•	clinopyroxene-tremolite alteration;"												
"•	magnetite-actinolite alteration;"												
"•	serpentine alteration."												
The clinopyroxene-tremolite skarns appear temporally to predate the magnetite-actinolite												
"stage, and the serpentinisation stage is the youngest, post-dating the mineralisation event."

"In the Fe-richest part of the deposit, serpentine is the dominant gangue mineral. At higher"												
"grades, the magnetite mineralisation is locally semi-massive. In some zones, a biotite- and"												
albite-rich alteration assemblage is prevalent with associated elevated amounts of												
"aluminium, indicating the protolith may have been an intercalated silicate-rich rock rather"												
than the dolomite. A substantial percentage of the deposit is characterized by breccia-style												
"mineralisation in which magnetite with actinolite ± biotite brecciate the host rock. Typically,"												
"the host is clinopyroxene-tremolite skarn, but in places the host rock is dolomitic marble."												
"The sole mineralisation mineral at Tapuli is magnetite, although small amounts of"												
chalcopyrite have been detected in relatively sulfur-rich layers near the footwall at depth.												
"Pyrite and pyrrhotite occur locally, usually in isolated, trace amounts in the upper, low-"												
"sulfur portion of the deposit. In the sulfur-richer parts of the deposit, these two minerals"												
provide the primary sources of sulfur.

"7	DEPOSIT TYPES"												
"Historically, the deposits of the Kaunisvaara Iron Ore field have been interpreted as"												
"examples of a broad group of magnetite-dominated, Ca-Mg- and Mg-silicate skarn-hosted"												
"deposits, which occur throughout Northern Sweden. These deposits are located within a"												
Karelian volcano-sedimentary domain and are generally referred to as “skarn iron ores” and												
as such may be metamorphosed banded iron formations or some other similar type of												
"syngenetic iron formation (for example, Frietsch, 1997). The deposits are comprised of"												
"several bands, or lenses of magnetite skarn, concordant with the surrounding skarn and"												
sedimentary host rocks.												
"Although little copper and gold mineralisation is apparent in these deposits, several features"												
"indicate that an IOCG model also has its merits, including:"												
"•	The brecciated textures commonly observed in the mineralised zones indicate that the"												
magnetite is epigenetic in origin.												
"•	Spatial correlation to the shear zone suggests the possibility that the mineralisation is"												
"structurally controlled. This is further supported by the fact that within the region,"												
fairly similar magnetite ± Cu-Au occurrences are known through the stratigraphical												
"sequence, such as at Northland’s Hannukainen deposit."												
"•	Although syngenetic iron formations are known in the Karelian sequence further west"												
"of Pajala area, no examples are known in Pajala-Kolari district."												
"•	Elevated concentrations of La and Ce have been detected from Sahavaara (Lindroos)."												
"These elements are atypical for syngenetic iron formations, indicating evidence that"												
the iron mineralisation may be a hydrothermal replacement type. Also suggestive of												
"epigenetic origins - chlorine is evident locally at values over 0.1%, suggesting"												
"involvement of highly saline fluids, and geochemically anomalous values are also"												
detected in correlation with iron grades.												
"•	Available isotopic dating of the mineralisation (from Hannukainen) suggest that"												
"mineralisation formed relatively ""late"", these ages thus being more consistent with"												
epigenetic than syngenetic origin.												
"Although none of the three deposits contain any significant Cu or Au mineralisation, they"												
display some other features of an IOCG-type of system. One typical feature for the known												
"IOCG-belts (for example, Cloncurry in Australia) is that numerous epigenetic magnetite"												
and/or hematite deposits occur amongst the Fe-Cu-Au deposits.

"8	MINERALIZATION"												
"8.1	Sahavaara"												
"At Sahavaara, the mineralisation consists of one main lens and a smaller adjacent"												
mineralised lens. The main mineralisation domain (Stora Sahavaara) has a NNE-SSW strike												
"of 1300 m, dips 50-70 degrees west, plunges to the north and is concordant with the host"												
sedimentary rocks. The mineralisation is generally open down-dip below the limits of the												
resource model. This is interpreted to be due to the northerly plunge of the mineralised												
"body. On Section North-300, SGU drillhole 65001 intersected un-mineralised skarn at a"												
"vertical depth of 400 m and on Section 500-North, vertical drillhole 65001 targeting the"												
down dip extension did not intersect mineralisation at a depth of 700 m from surface. The												
Stora Sahavaara magnetite body tapers at its northern and southern ends reaching a												
maximum of 90 m thick with an average thickness of about 45 m.												
"The adjacent lens, Sodra (South) Sahavaara, is located to the south and en echelon to the"												
main zone of mineralisation. Sodra Sahavaara averages about 20 m in thickness and is												
"discontinuous along strike for 1000 m. Lithology, mineralisation and attitude of the"												
mineralised horizon are similar to those of the main Stora Sahavaara zone.												
A number of smaller lenses of mineralisation occur in the skarn next to the main mineralised												
"zone and there are places where small skarn intercalations, poor in magnetite, develop inside"												
"the main zone. A discontinuous zone of magnetite mineralisation, historically referred to as"												
Ostra (East) Sahavaara is several meters wide and located approximately 200 m east and												
parallel to the main zone.												
"The mineralisation comprises magnetite, serpentine, pyrrhotite, pyrite, and tremolite."												
"Phlogopite, diopside, chlorite, talc, valleriite, chalcopyrite, graphite, scapolite, vesuvianite,"												
and apatite also occur as minor constituent minerals. Magnetite is currently the main mineral												
"of economic interest in the Sahavaara deposit, occurring as massive to semi-massive"												
"mineralisation, gradational to banded mineralisation near the footwall. The concentration of"												
mineralisation is slightly higher toward the hanging wall compared to the footwall.												
Typically magnetite occurs as fine-grained (0.1-0.3 mm) disseminated mineralisation;												
however coarser-grained (0.8-1.0 mm) mineralisation occurs locally and is relatively												
common.												
"Pyrrhotite, pyrite, valleriite, and chalcopyrite occur locally and sporadically within the"												
magnetite deposit as clots or patches of disseminated mineralisation and also as narrow												
veins from less than 1 mm up to 10 mm in width. The average sulfur content of the main												
mineralisation domain is 2.8%S with little variation. The main sulphide mineral is pyrrhotite												
(4.9% by volume) followed by pyrite (1.1% by volume). The southern part of the												
mineralisation contains almost no pyrite at all but increases along trend to the north with a												
consequent systematic change in the pyrite-pyrrhotite ratio along strike with the former												
"highest and the latter lowest in the northern part of the mineralisation (Lundberg, 1965)."

Page 39												
Valleriite and chalcopyrite occurs throughout the mineralised body as sporadic												
disseminations and as narrow veins. In general the amount of these Cu-minerals is low; the												
average Cu concentration in the mineralised zone is 0.08% and at such concentrations does												
not currently contribute to the economics of the deposit.												
"8.2	Tapuli"												
"The iron mineral at Tapuli is magnetite, with occasional trace amounts of chalcopyrite."												
"Pyrite, pyrrhotite, and tochinilite occur in trace amounts throughout the deposit. Higher"												
percentages are present within the lowermost layers near the footwall at the central portion												
of the deposit (Figure 8-1) and within the lens at Palotieva (Figure 8-2). Although copper												
"grades are quite low in the sulphide bearing zones, they still contain up to a few hundred"												
ppm Cu. With the exception of these lenses and occasional isolated pockets within the low-												
"sulphide zones, the mineralisation is generally low in sulphide content."												
"The majority of the mineralisation is a breccia-style where irregular bands, veins and blebs"												
"of magnetite, along with variable actinolite ± biotite brecciate the host clinopyroxene-"												
tremolite skarn rocks. Higher grade bands of semi-massive magnetite skarns (over												
"30 volume-% magnetite), varying in thickness from one to over 100 m, are intercalated"												
throughout the enveloping mineralised breccia zones. The magnetite skarns may contain as												
"high as 80 volume-% of magnetite, however these zones appear erratic between sections,"												
and so may represent a patchy distribution.												
Various skarn minerals comprise the gangue. The main gangue minerals are clinopyroxene												
"(diopside) and amphiboles (tremolite, actinolite, ferritshermacite). Locally, especially within"												
"the richest magnetite skarns, serpentine is the dominant gangue mineral. Minor to trace"												
"amounts of biotite, chlorite, calcite, and apatite occur locally."

"9	EXPLORATION"												
Northland has compiled an extensive database of available historical exploration												
"information for the Sahavaara and Tapuli deposits. In addition, the data for a number of"												
other deposits in the immediate vicinity have been incorporated into the current exploration												
programs.												
Due to the advanced stage of exploration and evaluation of the Sahavaara and Tapuli												
"magnetite deposits, Northland moved directly to drilling (described in detail below) and did"												
"not undertake any significant mapping or surface sampling, or any additional detailed"												
geochemical and geophysical surveys.

"10	DRILLING"												
"10.1	Sahavaara"												
"During 2005, Northland drilled 14 diamond core holes at Sahavaara for a total of 2,424 m."												
There were three objectives to the drilling program: to twin historic SGU drillholes; to												
collect fresh metallurgical samples; and to expand the current resource with both infill and												
step-out drilling.												
The drillholes are located along cross sections spaced 50 to 100 m apart and were oriented at												
an azimuth of 105°E with an inclination of about 60 degrees. The drillhole locations and												
downhole surveys used in the resource model are all based on the Swedish RT90 coordinate												
system.												
"The drilling program occurred in two phases, both completed by Kati Oy from Rautio,"												
Finland. The first phase involved the completion of four large diameter (103 mm) core holes												
for metallurgical samples. The drill-program completed during June and July 2005 was												
"managed by Frank van der Stijl, an experienced consultant geologist retained by Northland"												
and assisted by Asa Corin. The second consisted of 10 additional drillholes (75 mm												
diameter) completed during August and September 2005. The second phase of the program												
"was managed by Art Glover, a consultant geologist retained by Northland and assisted by"												
"Eric Yurko and Elin Siggberg. Vance V Thornsberry, PGeo, former Vice-President of"												
"Exploration for Northland, is the Qualified Person as defined in National Instrument 43-101"												
responsible for supervising the design and execution of the Sahavaara drilling programs.												
Northland re-established the SGU local drill-grid at Sahavaara and Northland’s drill- collars												
were duly referenced to the old grid. The SGU grid was re-established by locating old drill												
"casings and then hand brushing the original survey lines. Conveniently, in many instances,"												
the old grid stakes were located in the field. Once the grid lines had been brushed and grid												
"stations flagged, they were used to set foresights and back-sights to line-up stakes for the"												
drilling. A magnetic compass is not accurate in this terrain due to the strong influence of the												
magnetite mineralisation. The line-up stakes were preserved throughout the drilling												
operation to facilitate subsequent surveying of all drill collars grid lines by a licensed												
surveyor.												
Down-hole deviation surveys were completed on all of Northland’s drillholes. These were												
conducted by Kati personnel using a Maxibor down-hole deviation tool. The deviation												
results were used to correct the original inclination and azimuth of the hole.												
"Sample lengths of 1m were generally taken from the modern era drilling, and 2m from the"												
historical drilling in order to account for sections of thin mineralisation. The deposit is												
"generally 10m or thicker, with few areas pinching-out to <5m."

"10.2	Tapuli"												
Assays and geological logs were retrieved by Northland for the 26 historical (SGU)												
diamond boreholes on the property. The core measured 46 mm in diameter and the program												
"Totalled 6,280 m. The position of the drillholes was measured with a theodolite in a local"												
grid system tied to the Swedish national grid. Down-hole deviation (dip only) was routinely												
"surveyed as well. On drillhole completion, the casing was left in the ground and capped. All"												
SGU holes were found in the field in 2007. Core from four of the holes from the 800 section												
within the Central Tapuli deposit is currently stored at the SGU drill-core archive at Mala in												
"northern Sweden. SRK could not view this core, and is not aware of any assaying technique"												
information or QAQC data for these holes.												
"During 2007, Northland drilled 37 diamond core holes at Tapuli for a total of 5,695 m. The"												
"drilling was contracted to Kati Oy (25 holes) and SMOY (12 holes), both using a WL-76"												
"equipment, producing core with a diameter of 57.5 mm. There were principally three"												
"objectives to the drilling program: 1) to twin historic SGU drillholes, 2) to collect fresh"												
"metallurgical samples for test work, and 3) to expand the current resource with infill and"												
step out drilling.												
The 2007 drillholes were drilled at angles ranging between 60 and 65 degrees and directed												
"on an azimuth of 142.5°. The holes were drilled on a nominal 100 m grid, utilizing the same"												
profile system as the SGU. The parallel profiles are spaced (with two exceptions) 100 m												
apart (see Figure 5-3).												
"Beginning in September 2007 and continuing through April 2008, Northland drilled an"												
"additional 69 core holes for a total of 13,184 m. The drilling was contracted to Kati Oy (25"												
"holes), Lapin Asbesti OY (16 holes), Taiga Drilling AB (25 holes), and SMOY (3 holes)."												
"Both Kati and Lapin Asbesti used WL-76 equipment, producing core with a diameter of"												
"57.5 mm. Taiga used HQ equipment, producing a core with a diameter of 63.5 mm, and"												
"SMOY used WL-103 equipment, producing core with a diameter of 80.0 mm. There were"												
three objectives to the drilling program: 1) increase the drillhole sample density to advance												
modelled tonnes into measured and indicated resource categories; 2) to collect sufficient												
volume of core in the main central deposit to produce a bulk sample for pilot plant testing;												
and 3) to expand and more precisely delineate the current resource with infill and step out												
drilling.												
Holes outside of and on the main central deposit periphery were drilled at 60° and directed												
on an azimuth of 142.5°. Most of the holes within the central portion had a two-fold												
objective: 1) fill-in sample spacing to a nominal 50-m grid; and 2) provide a volume of core												
to produce a 25 t bulk sample for pilot plant testing. These holes were drilled at a 90°												
vertical angle.												
"All the drillholes were integrated into the database, containing 130 holes for 24,475 m of"												
"drilling and a total of 15,941 iron analyses used in the estimation of the Tapuli mineral"												
resource. The drillhole locations and down-hole surveys used in this model are all located in												
"the Swedish national grid, RT90 coordinates."

Northland’s drillholes have all had the location surveyed by a qualified surveyor from												
"PICAB BYGGPLANERING, using a Real-Time Kinematic GPS equipment. Deviation"												
"surveys were conducted on all but 8 holes in 2008, utilizing standard MAXIBOR and"												
Deviflex systems. A few holes in 2008 were not available to survey as hole conditions												
would not allow or ice conditions indicated timely evacuation of the drill site for safety												
reasons was advisable before surveys could be conducted. All historical drillholes were also												
relocated by PICAB surveyors as well as by Northland.												
"Sample lengths of 1m were generally taken from the modern era drilling, and 2m from the"												
historical drilling in order to account for sections of thin mineralisation. The deposit is												
"generally 20m or thicker, with few areas pinching-out to <10m."												
"10.3	Geological and Geotechnical Logging"												
"10.3.1	Previous Explorers - Geological and Geotechnical Logging of the SGU holes"												
The following information is summarized from personal communication with Hardy												
"Lindroos, SGU project geologist for the historical exploration program:"												
The geological logging was conducted by the SGU geologists at LKAB's core archive in												
"Kiruna, using a standard protocol, similar to current practice, utilizing the geologist’s"												
"observation of the rocks, and other tests conducted on the cores such as their reaction to"												
"magnets, and the data from magnetic susceptibility logs conducted on the core. In addition,"												
"microscopic studies were conducted on a significant amount of thin sections, with many"												
studied as polished sections. The thin section studies were important for SGU and LKAB to												
understand the mineral assemblages related to the mineralisation.												
The original geological logs obtained from the historical drilling conducted by the SGU												
were translated from Swedish to English by Northland. The drill-hole logs conventionally												
"describe the various lithologies and relevant geological and structural attributes, with"												
qualitative descriptions of zones of strong fracturing or broken rock. No quantitative												
"geotechnical measurements, such as RQD, were discovered. Mineralised core intervals were"												
selected and recorded for assaying from all magnetite-bearing horizons. The translated												
lithological descriptions were standardized to rock types synonymous with Northland’s												
descriptors. A database was created by tabulating drillhole information and lithological												
intervals were coded according to rock type. Cross sections were then generated to facilitate												
interpretations of geological cross sections.												
"10.3.2	Northland’s Geological and Geotechnical Logging"												
"All of Northland’s drill cores were logged to capture all relevant geological, geophysical"												
(susceptibility logs) and geotechnical information by Northland geologists. In addition to												
"this, photos were taken of each core box, with both wet and dry core. The geologic logging"												
intervals were based on lithological variations in the rock. Geological and geotechnical												
observations were entered directly into a Microsoft Access database and after June 2008												
transferred into a Century Systems database called FUSION. Standard RQD measurements												
were made on the core and tabulated by hand. This data was then entered into a Microsoft

Excel spreadsheet that was later imported into a Microsoft Access table and later to												
FUSION.												
"Major problems have been found with the FUSION database software, with the tracking of"												
"batch numbers, assay method, assay type and other data. The use of FUSION has been seen"												
to decrease database integrity and may result in inaccurate data being transferred between												
"users of the data. This system should be replaced by a more robust databasing system, in"												
order to prevent future problems with data capture and storage.												
During the spring of 2008 all data was transferred into Century Systems FUSION database												
to improve data integrity. All data acquisition done after the implementation of Fusion was												
"done directly into DHLogger. The geologists first log the Collar, major and minor geology,"												
"than the details tabs (alteration, colour, structure, oxides, sulphides and texture) into"												
"DHLogger. The RQD, magnetic susceptibility, and rock mechanics data are entered into a"												
csv format template and imported into the Local database. The data validation is completed												
during the import.												
The downhole survey and surveyed coordinates for individual drillholes are imported after												
completion of the hole into Fusion Remote by the database administrator.												
When the drillhole is created on the user’s local PC database it is created into the Fusion												
"Remote, utilizing the Fusion Client tool. Fusion Client is a data management tool that runs"												
on a user PC and is used to facilitate the movement of data between a Remote database and												
a Local database. The same tool is used to ensure the synchronization between Fusion												
"Remote database located at Northland's office in Pajala, Sweden, and the central database"												
"located at the Northland's office in Lulea, Sweden. A Check In / Check Out system within"												
Fusion Client always ensures that users have access to the latest data. This allows users to												
"continue logging data that was previously started, out in the field and at the source of the"												
data.

"11	SAMPLING METHOD AND APPROACH"												
"11.1	Historical Sampling Methods and Approaches"												
"According to Hardy Lindroos (personal communication), the Geological Survey of Sweden,"												
"SGU, utilized a standard professional protocol for the sampling for all deposits in the Iron"												
Ore Inventory project. It is readily apparent that sampling intervals commence and finish												
based on visual estimates of magnetite mineralisation. Irregular sample lengths were used												
"within these intervals, ranging between 0.2 to 6.0 m at Sahavaara, most commonly found are"												
1 and 2 m sample lengths. Core size was 46 mm and core halves were utilized for the												
"sampling. The selected sample sections were sawed in half at LKAB’s facility in Kiruna,"												
and drill cores were stored in an underground archive in Kiruna. A limited number of the												
holes are still held in storage at the SGU national core archive in Mala.												
"11.2	Northland’s Recent Sampling Methods and Approaches"												
"All the mineralised zones of the core were sampled, along with a reasonable amount of"												
altered skarn above the magnetite-bearing material and up to about 10 m of footwall rocks to												
ensure that the mineralisation was entirely captured. Sample intervals started and stopped												
"slightly beyond the visual limits of the mineralised skarn zone. Within these boundaries, the"												
standard sample interval was 1 m. Once the geologic and geotechnical logging was												
"completed, the sample intervals were marked onto the core boxes and photographed. The"												
sample intervals and numbers were entered directly into a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet												
which was later imported into a Microsoft Access database. After the change in the database												
"management system, the sampling information is now logged directly into DHLogger with"												
"sample number, amount of sample etc. During this process, standards, blanks and duplicates"												
are included to allow for the QA/QC checks of geochemical data.												
"When the drillhole logging process is completed, the hole is “Checked In” into Fusion"												
Remote using the Fusion Client tool. When assays become available from the laboratory												
(ALS Chemex) they are imported directly into Fusion remote by the database administrator.												
The lab (ALS Chemex) will typically return the CSV import file using the required lab												
import file format.												
The Lab Import function within Century Systems conducts validation on the assays prior to												
and during the import process. In particular it checks; •												
"•	that the sample numbers have been entered into the database;"												
"•	that the structure of the file supplied by the lab is correct;"												
"•	that all the necessary columns are present in the file; and"												
"•	that the field and lab standards are assessed against the defined tolerances."												
"The mineralisation was sampled in an unbiased fashion, with all mineralised zones sampled"												
"using the same technique, with up to 10m of waste rock sampled either side of the"												
mineralised zone to ensure the entire mineralised is analysed. The drill core observed during												
"the site visit to the Pajala core shed showed very good recovery and a good quality core,"												
with no obvious impact on the quality of the Resource Estimate.

"12	SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES AND SECURITY"												
"The sample preparation was partly conducted by the issuer, and partly by an independent"												
"company to the issuer. SRK was not involved with any of the sampling procedures, so"												
cannot comment on the security or handling along the sample chain. The structure of the												
preparation is highlighted below.												
"12.1	Historical Chain of Custody, Sample Preparation and Analyses"												
No information is currently available on the specific sampling procedures used in each of												
"the various historical drilling campaigns. In the past, sampling intervals appear to commence"												
and finish based on visual estimates of magnetite mineralisation. Regular sample lengths												
"were used within these intervals. According to Hardy Lindroos (personal communication),"												
"SGU and LKAB utilized a standard protocol for the assaying, conducted at LKAB’s"												
"laboratory in Kiruna which specialized in iron assays and the main sulphides. Fe, P, and"												
elements with higher atomic numbers were analyzed by neutron activation. All assay results												
were signed by the laboratory chief.												
Northland’s technicians and/or geologists picked up cores at the drill site on a daily basis												
"when drills were operating. From there, the core was transported to Northland’s logging and"												
"core handling facility at Akasjokisuu for the earlier 2008 drilling, and later to the Pajala core"												
"logging facilities, by pick-up trucks and/or trailers."												
"During the logging stage, the core is measured and core recovery calculated, marking down"												
each 1 m interval on the box and on the core with a green felt tip pen. The intervals selected												
by the geologist for sample analyses are also marked on the box and the core with a red felt												
tip pen. The sample number and its respective sample interval in down-hole metres are also												
written on the box.												
The core intervals selected for analysis are generally cut in half. Northland technicians at												
both the Akasjokisuu and the Pajala facilities cut down the long axis of the core utilizing a												
circular diamond saw. Both halves of the sawn core are then returned to their respective												
position in the core box. Drill core intended for resource delineation as well as for												
"metallurgical testwork has been treated differently. Generally, half the core has been assayed"												
"and a quarter has been used for testwork. In case of a large diameter core, it has been split"												
so that a quarter has gone to an assay laboratory and half has gone to metallurgical testwork.												
The samples from each individual hole were palletized as batches and transported by												
"Northland personnel to the BUSSGODS shipping facility in Pajala, Sweden, and the"												
transportation company completed the shipment to the Pitea facility. The ALS Chemex staff												
then confirms receiving the shipment on the ALS Chemex webtrieve www-page. All												
shipments were received within 24 to 48 hours.

"12.2	Magnasat Measurements"												
Magnasat readings are used to determine the proportion of a tested sample that is magnetic.												
The original Satmagan method (precursor to Magnasat) was developed as an instrument to												
quickly analyze magnetite mineralisation process streams in order to provide information to												
control the process performance. The measurement is based on the pull of a sample inserted												
"in a magnetic field, which causes the ferromagnetic components to be magnetically"												
saturated.												
The Magnasat method is different in that the sample is passed through a funnel that has												
instrumentation to determine a change in the magnetic field at different settings of field												
"strength. In other words, the amount of material identified as magnetic at selected"												
"susceptibility levels can be measured. Hence, not only magnetite (and other ferromagnetic"												
"components such as monoclinic pyrrhotite) can be analyzed, other less susceptible materials"												
"such as ilmenite and leucoxene can be analyzed. Unfortunately, there is no distinction"												
"between highly magnetic materials, such as magnetite and magnetic pyrrhotite. Also, there"

"At high magnetite content levels, the precision is fairly poor for both types of methods."												
Satmagan can have up to 2.2% error. The Magnasat error level is not known presently.												
"Northland provided 1,457 Magnasat readings from Sahavaara and 14,546 Magnasat readings"												
"from Tapuli and Palotieva for the resource estimate, using the same pulps sent to ALS"												
Chemex for assaying for the readings.												
"12.3	Bulk Density Determination"												
"12.3.1	Historical Measurements and Estimations"												
The SGU and Northland both used the Archimedes’ method of weighing the specimens dry												
"and immersed in water, also taking into account the porosity, to determine the density."												
"Northland's samples vary in weight from approx 750 g to a maximum of 1,500 g. The scale"												
is connected to the computer for automatic registration of weights to avoid later errors in												
data registration. The scale is considered to be accurate to 0.01 g.												
"The SGU and Northland performed density determinations on a regular basis, for Sahavaara,"												
"665 historical (1960s-1970s) determinations and 1,202 post 1970s determinations were"												
"available, mostly from what is considered to be within the mineralisation envelopes and for"												
"Tapuli, 2,359 samples were measured, mostly from what is considered to be within the"												
mineralisation envelopes. The iron content was determined as described in the assay section												
and the specific gravity was determined using the following method:												
Wet specimens were placed in a basket and then submerged in a vessel containing water.												
The mass of each specimen in water was then recorded. Samples were wiped dry and the												
"mass of each specimen was recorded. A balance was used for mass determination, the"												
"accuracy of which is not known. Based on the recorded readings it is, however, believed to"												
be accurate to 0.1 g and was especially equipped with a hook and basket for weighing in												
water.												
The density of the samples was calculated using the following formula:												
Density = mass (air) / (mass (air) - mass (water))												
"12.4	Data Verification"												
"Northland maintains its own QA/QC program consisting of inserting blanks, duplicates and"												
standards to the analytical process.												
"12.4.1	Field Blank"												
The field blank is used to monitor cleaning of the sample preparation equipment (jaw												
"crusher, pulveriser mill). Northland uses commercial, very low S, Cu-Au free sauna stove"												
rock (diabase) as field blank.

"12.4.2	Standards"												
A total of four internal standards were prepared from the Stora Sahavaara magnetite												
"mineralisation in 2007. Of these, three standards were made to represent high, medium, and"												
low iron grades from core samples. The core samples were selected from the 2005 drilling												
"by Northland geologist, Dr Tero Niiranen. A fourth, very-high iron grade standard was"												
"selected from a metallurgical test work concentrate made by SGS, Lakefield. The sample"												
"preparation and standards were performed by SGS, Lakefield."												
The standards were prepared from the coarse rejects of the drill samples. Each of the												
samples weighed between 1.5 and 2.0 kg depending on the sample length and lithology. The												
objective was to prepare approximately 25 kg of material for each sample for shipment to												
SGS. The acronyms used in standard names stand for Northland Exploration Sweden.												
Samples were collected from several drillholes throughout the mineralisation to provide a												
representative composite of the mineralisation. The standards were designed for the												
following iron grades:												
"•	NES-1	~ 60%	Fe	High grade iron"												
"•	NES-2	~ 40%	Fe	Medium grade iron"												
"•	NES-3	~ 25%	Fe	Low grade iron"												
When received by SGS the samples were milled to 95% passing 200 meshes. The +200												
mesh material was discarded and the remaining -200 mesh material was dried and tumble												
homogenized. Ten samples were obtained for homogeneity testing and the homogeneity data												
was forwarded Northland for approval. A rotary splitter was then used to separate the												
sample into approximately 1 kg lots. Approximately 50 g aliquots were hand sampled from												
the rotary split samples and packaged in paper sample bags. The sample bags were then												
vacuum sealed in foil over-packs. Thirty 50 g samples were randomly selected and were												
labelled for characterization testing. Five of these samples were submitted to each of the												
"following laboratories: ALS Chemex, Vancouver; ACME Laboratory, Vancouver;"												
"International Plasma Laboratories, Richmond, Canada; Genalysis, Perth, Australia; GTK,"												
"Rovaniemi, Finland; and OMAC, Ireland. 545 packets were labelled and shipped to"												
"Northland and were used for the late 2008 and 2009 Stora Sahavaara, Tapuli and Pellivuoma"												
standard checks.												
NES-1 and NES-2 have Cu grades that are sufficient for a Cu standard. Contained Cu in												
NES-3 is too close to detection limits of some assay methods for this purpose. The samples												
"do not have sufficient Au grades, but gold checks are not necessary, as it is found in"												
"occasional, negligible amounts in the Kaunisvaara project. Standards were instructed to be"												
"inserted into the sample train to have at least one in every 61 samples, with alternating"												
"samples each time. Blanks were instructed to have been inserted one in 81 samples, so that"												
one out of 27 samples to the laboratory should have been a quality control check. •

"•	NES - 3 - This company internal standard has recommended Fe grade of 25.71% ±"

"12.4.3	Laboratory Duplicates"												
The laboratory was instructed to produce a split duplicate ampoule of pulverized sample												
"material from one out of 27 samples, for cross checking the laboratory quality. The"												
laboratory duplicates are then sent to a different laboratory to be analyzed with the same												
methods. The QC-spares from the late 2008 and 2009 drilling at the Kaunisvaara projects’												
deposits were sent to Labtium Ltd OY/AB (Labtium) laboratories (formerly the												
"geolaboratory of the Geological Survey of Finland) in Espoo, Finland for duplicate assaying."												
"Labtium is accredited by FINAS, signatory of the EA (European co-operation for"												
"Accreditation), ILAC (International Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation) and IAF"												
"(International Accreditation Forum Inc.), achieving global acceptance and recognition of the"												
accreditation and quality system of Labtium.												
"Summarized, one out of 27 samples assayed during the 2008 and 2009 drilling should have"												
"been the field blank, NES-1, NES-2, or the NES-3 standard. In addition a laboratory"												
duplicate should have been analyzed in one out of 27 assays for the purpose of cross												
checking at a different laboratory.												
"12.5	QAQC Summary"												
It is the opinion of SRK that Northland has not followed the sound QAQC practices which												
were proposed by Northland. It is the opinion of SRK that an insufficient number of samples												
have been incorporated in to the sample stream. Whilst SRK recognises that 17% of the												
"database comprises historical data with no historic QAQC reporting possible, the more"												
recent drilling is not sufficiently supported with modern QAQC checks. It is also the opinion												
"of SRK that the chosen blank, being a diabase with an inherent Fe and S content is not"												
suitable for purpose and that grade deviations in the results of the blank samples could be												
attributed to either the poor homogeneity of the blank or laboratory contamination. The												
umpire laboratory checks showed a strong correlation between assay grades and SRK is												
therefore confident in the repeatability of the sample preparation process.												
It is the recommendation of SRK that at least 10% of future assaying is supported with												
"regular QAQC comprising the use of certified standards, appropriate blank samples,"												
laboratory duplicates and the addition of field duplicates to check the sample preparation												
"processes. That said, it is the opinion of SRK that the results of the limited number of"												
certified standards used and the results of the laboratory duplicates show that a reasonable												
level of confidence can be attributed to the more recent drill samples used in the Mineral												
Resource Estimate.

"12.6	Northland Verification of Historical Drilling Results"												
Northland obtained the original hardcopies of drill logs and assays from the SGU. A												
"verification exercise was conducted on the historic data, which included: review of drillhole"												
logs and plots; location and verifying the location of drill collars and a review of drillhole												
surveys and orientation data. In addition twin-hole programmes were set up for each project												
to check for lithology and assay reliability.												
The twin-hole program at Sahavaara comprises three holes and there is generally a good												
"correlation between Northland’s drilling and the historical drilling of SGU, however two of"												
the three twinned drillholes indicate that locally there is significant short-range variability in												
both grade and thickness.												
The first of the two holes twinned at Tapuli show very good correlation while the second												
exhibited somewhat less correlation. This is probably due to inaccurate collaring of the hole												
so that it deviated 15 degrees from the original SGU hole resulting in a large spatial												
difference between the samples.

"13.1	Most significant Fe and Cu deposits in Northern Fennoscandia"												
The economically most important iron deposits in northern Fennoscandia are the Kiruna and												
"Malmberget magnetite-apatite deposits, both currently operated by LKAB. The Kiruna"												
"deposit, located 150 km northwest from the Pajala area and discovered in 1696, has been"												
mined on a regular basis since 1900. The ore is currently mined underground.												
"The Kiruna iron deposit is approximately 5 km long, up to 100 m thick, steeply dipping with"												
the sole mineral of economic interest being magnetite. The ore body is hosted by felsic												
volcanic rocks within a Svecofennian supracrustal sequence known as the Kiruna Porphyry												
"Group (Offerberg et al, 1967). A recent genetic model of the Kiruna deposit suggests that"												
the magnetite was crystallized directly from an iron-phosphorus rich magma (Nystrom &												
"Henriques, 1994). It has been proposed that the Kiruna-type magnetite-apatite deposits"												
"would have been formed as an end-member of the IOCG class of iron ores (Hintzman et al,"												
1992).												
Another currently operating iron mine is the Malmberget magnetite-apatite deposit located												
"at Gallivare in Sweden, about 100 km NW from Pajala. The Malmberget deposit consists of"												
some 20 ore bodies over an underground area about 5 by 2.5 km. The mineralisation type is												
the same as found at Kiruna. The Malmberget deposit is hosted by highly metamorphosed												
felsic volcanic rocks which are considered to be metamorphosed equivalents of the Kiruna												
Porphyry Group rocks that host the Kiruna deposit. Seven of the known ore bodies are												
currently being mined by LKAB.												
"The currently largest copper deposit in production in Europe, Aitik, is located some 18 km"												
away from Malmberget. Aitik was discovered in 1930 and has been in production since												
1960s.												
The bulk of the ore at Aitik is hosted in rocks of the Svecofennian Porphyry Group and												
specifically altered intermediate to felsic metavolcanic and subvolcanic intrusions next to a												
quartz monzodioritic of which the latter is also weakly mineralised. The deposit has been												
"interpreted as a metamorphosed porphyry deposit (for example, Wanhainen et al., 2003)."												
"13.2	Deposits in the Pajala-Kolari region"												
Over 30 historical Fe and Fe-Cu-Au deposits and occurrences are known within 50 km												
"distance of the Pajala project area (Figure 3-2). Of these, the Rautuvaara and Hannukainen"												
deposits were mined by Rautaruukki during the period 1974-1990.

"15	MINERAL RESOURCE AND	MINERAL RESERVE ESTIMATES"												
"15.1	Introduction"												
The most up to date Mineral Resource and Reserve estimates for the Kaunisvaara project												
were produced by SRK in 2010 for inclusion in the Feasibility Study. The comments below												
summarise the methodology used to derive and classify these Mineral Resource and Reserve												
estimates. The Mineral Resource estimates given in this report are presented inclusive of												
those transferred to Mineral Reserves and are therefore not additional to these.												
"15.2	Geological Modelling"												
"The preliminary statistical review undertaken showed that magnetite, being the principal Fe"												
"source for the project, is present within all of the logged skarn lithologies at Sahavaara and"												
"Tapuli. A review of the Magnasat data shows that with increasing %Fe Total content, an"												
"increasing magnetic signature with a linear relationship is observed. Additionally, through"												
"the visual inspection of the diamond drill core for the various logged lithologies, it is clear"												
"that magnetite is present within the lower grade skarn lithologies, although clearly"												
disseminated.												
"Notwithstanding the above, SRK recognises that a portion of the %Fe Total, especially in"												
"the lower grade skarn lithologies, will be related to Fe silicates, though this is concentrated"												
within material with a %Fe Total content of less than 10%. Whilst Fe silicates may be												
"present within material with a Fe Total grade in excess of 10%, there is clearly a dominant"												
magnetite content in this material and given this a lower boundary of 10%Fe Total was used												
to separate the mineralised from none mineralised skarn units at both Sahavaara and Tapuli.												
At Sahavaara an upper cut-off of 50%Fe Total was used to generate a continuous high grade												
"domain and at both Sahavaara and Tapuli, internal zones of continuous un-mineralised skarn"												
"were also domained based on a 10%Fe Total grade. At Tapuli, additional domains were"												
created that separated out high and low sulfur zones. The 10 %Fe Total mineralisation												
domain created for Tapuli is also cross cut by vertical fault structures with the mineralisation												
domain abutting against the faults in places.												
"Figure 15-1 and Figure 15-2 show the mineralisation wireframes, based on a 10 %Fe Total"												
cut off for Sahavaara and Tapuli.

The deposit modelling was conducted in Datamine Studio 3 software. The modelling												
process comprised:												
"•	importing the collar, survey, assay, geology, Magnasat and magnetic susceptibility"												
data into Datamine to create a desurveyed drillhole file (Figure 5-2);												
"•	importing the topography data file covering the project area;"												
"•	the creation of mineralisation wireframes for Stora Sahavaara, Sodra Sahavaara,"												
Tapuli and Palotieva based on the domain guidelines generated from the statistical												
review; and												
"•	the creation of an empty block model coded by zone to distinguish the different"												
geological domains identified.

%S.												
The Coefficient of Variation (CoV) can be used to describe the shape of the distribution and												
is defined as the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean. A CoV greater than 1 indicates												
the presence of some erratic high values that may have a significant impact on the final												
"estimation. Within the mineralisation zones at Sahavaara, CoV values greater than 1 are"												
restricted to minor elements with the exception of %S in Zone 130 and at Tapuli CoV values												
greater than 1 are restricted to minor elements with the exception of %S in Zones 110 and												
"120, the low sulfur domains, where isolated high sulfur assays are present ."												
"In general, the grade distribution noted for the domain subsets are near normal to negatively"												
skewed due to the inclusion of low grade samples that cannot be separately domained. The												
majority of the sulfur domains are however positively skewed corresponding with the high												
CoV observed.												
"15.5	Geostatistical Review"												
"Directional experimental semi-variograms were produced for Fe Total, Al2O3, CaO, K2O,"												
"MgO, Mn, P, S, SiO2 and TiO2. The semi-variograms were produced using a 4 m (composite"												
length) lag in the downhole direction allowing the short-scale structures and nugget variance												
"to be determined. At Sahavaara, along strike (022°) and down-dip (63° to the west)"												
"variograms were then produced with the nugget fixed from the downhole variogram, and"												
using a lag spacing of 50 m with a 50% tolerance being applied to the lag spacing. This												
spacing was chosen to mirror the minimum drillhole spacing within the Sahavaara project.												
No plunge has been identified by Northland and none was evident from the variography.												
"At Tapuli, along strike (060°) and down-dip (45° to the northwest) variograms were then"												
"produced with the nugget fixed from the downhole variogram, and using a lag spacing of"												
50 m with a 50% tolerance being applied to the lag spacing. This spacing was chosen to												
mirror the minimum drillhole spacing in the along strike direction. No plunge has been

The results of the variography were used in the interpolation to assign the appropriate												
weighting to the samples pairs being utilised to calculate the block model grade. The total												
ranges modelled have also been used to help define the optimum search parameters and the												
"search ellipse dimensions used in the interpolation. Ideally, sample pairs that fall within the"												
range of the variogram where a strong covariance exists between the sample pairs should be												
utilised if the data allows. Applying a 2/3rd rule to the total range of the variograms in the												
search ellipse dimensions forces the interpolation to use samples where the covariance												
between samples exists.												
"As a result of the variography, Ordinary Kriging (OK) was deemed the most appropriate"												
interpolation technique with a Quantitative Kriging Neighbourhood Analysis (QKNA) being												
undertaken prior to interpolation. QKNA provides a useful technique that uses												
mathematically sound tools to optimise a search area. It is an invaluable step in determining												
the correct search area for any estimation or simulation exercise.												
"15.6	Topographic Data"												
"A topographic survey was conducted to produce an accurate topographic surface, which was"												
used use to cut mineralisation wireframes in order to report volume and tonnes accurately.												
The helicopter airborne topographic surveys were performed on 30th May2008 for												
"Sahavaara and Tapuli at an altitude of 750 m by Poyry Environment Ltd, who have verified"												
the laser data and images produced. Laser scanning data were transformed from ellipsoidal												
height system (ETRS/GRS80) to orthometric system by using national geoid models.												
Reference height point sets were field surveyed by measuring 5 x 5 size grids or height												
profiles on hard flat surfaces with 1-2 m grid spacing. Six sets were measured from both												
study areas. Survey points were compared to classified laser data ground point and set based												
average differences were calculated. Expected values were achieved for vertical and planar												
accuracies. SRK has verified that this data is viable for use in a Mineral Resource Estimate.												
"15.7	Density Modelling"												
"In the ore domains, at Sahavaara, a total of 1,202 density samples are present from the post"												
"1960s era drilling and at Tapuli, 1,605 density samples are present within Zones 110 and"												
111. A strong correlation existing between %Fe Total and density and was therefore deemed												
appropriate to interpolate the density values into the block model via a regression formula												
based on the %Fe Total grade. Each plot has been fitted with a second order polynomial												
trendline and the resultant equation that has been used to calculate density into the block												
model upon completion of the interpolation.												
"In addition, at Sahavaara, a total of 310 density measurements have been taken from the"												
"different waste domains and at Tapuli, 764. Average density values have been applied to the"												
block model for the various waste domains identified at Sahavaara and Tapuli.

"At Sahavaara, an empty block model was generated using the mineralisation and host"												
lithology wireframes with blocks of 25mY by 10mX by 12mZ dimension. These block												
dimensions approximate half the drillhole spacing along strike (25m) and the assumed												
working bench height of the operating pit (12m). A block width of 10m was chosen due to												
"the overall dimensions of the mineralisation. At Tapuli, an empty block model was"												
generated using the mineralisation and host lithology wireframes with blocks of 25mY by												
25mX by 12mZ dimension. These block dimensions approximate half the drillhole spacing												
along strike (25 m) and the assumed working bench height of the operating pit (12 m).

"The resulting blocks were classified into the Measured, Indicated and Inferred Resource"												
categories. Measured Resources have been limited to the areas which have been subjected to												
close spaced drilling. SRK is confident in the accuracy of the estimates in these areas due to												
the:												
"•	low geological complexity;"												
"•	drillhole spacing of much	less than the 2/3rd geostatistical range along strike;"												
"•	all blocks were estimated	in search volume one, using the optimum search parameters"												
determined; and												
"•	slope of regression values dominantly greater than 0.8."												
"Indicated Resources at Sahavaara were delineated on the basis of all the information above,"												
except with a slope of regression dominantly greater than 0.5.												
Inferred Resources at Sahavaara were delineated by extending the Indicated boundary 50m												
down-dip and ensuring that the deeper drillhole intercepts are encapsulated.												
At Tapuli the Measured Resource was limited to the central area on the basis of the												
following criteria:												
"•	reasonably low geological complexity;"												
"•	drillhole spacing of much	less than the 2/3rd geostatistical range along strike;"												
"•	all blocks were estimated	in search volume one, using the optimum search parameters"												
determined; and												
"•	slope of regression values dominantly greater than 0.8."												
"Indicated Resources at Tapuli were delineated on the basis of all the information above,"												
except with a slope of regression dominantly greater than 0.5.												
Inferred Resources at Tapuli were delineated by extending the Indicated boundary 50 m												
down-dip and ensuring that the deeper drillhole intercepts are encapsulated.												
"Finally, a pit optimisation exercise was then undertaken so as to limit the resource statement"												
to the material that SRK considers has a reasonable prospect of economic extraction. This												
exercise was not undertaken to generate a Mineral Reserve and was purely used to assist in												
determining at what depth to limit the reported resource. Notably it assumed an Fe dmtu												
Price of USD110 (higher than that used to define Mineral Reserves as commented upon												
below).

"15.10	Mineral Resource Statement"												
As commented above the Mineral Resource Statement generated by SRK has been restricted												
to all classified material falling within the Whittle shell representing a metal price of 110												
US0/dmtu for magnetite concentrate. This represents the material which SRK considers has												
reasonable prospect for eventual economic extraction. Table 15-3 shows the resulting												
Mineral Resource Statement for Sahavaara and Table 15-4 shows the resulting Mineral												
Resource Statement for Tapuli.												
The statement has been reported by Qualified Person Howard Baker (MAusIMM) in												
"accordance with the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (CIM)"												
Standards on Mineral Resources and Reserves (the CIM Code) and has an effective date of												
"26th March, 2010."												
"The quantity and grade of the reported inferred resource are uncertain in nature, there has"												
been insufficient exploration to define these as an indicated or measured mineral resource;												
and it is uncertain if further exploration will result in upgrading them to an indicated or												
measured mineral resource category in due course.												
"In total, SRK has derived a combined Measured plus Indicated Mineral Resource for Sodra"												
"Sahavaara and Stora Sahavaara of 86.8 Mt grading 39.82%Fe Total, 1.93%S, 18.26% SiO2"												
"and 14.63% MgO. Of this, 30.2 Mt grading 42.96%Fe Total and 2.66%S has been reported"												
as Measured and 56.6 Mt grading 38.14%Fe Total and 1.55%S as Indicated. In addition												
some 34.7 Mt grading 37.28%Fe Total and 1.44; %S has been reported as an Inferred												
Mineral Resource. Some 13.8 Mt of the Measured plus Indicated Mineral Resource												
comprises “high grade” material and has a mean grade of 53.38%Fe Total and 3.03%S.												
In addition SRK has derived a Measured plus Indicated Mineral Resource for Tapuli of												
"107.4Mt grading 26.01%Fe Total, 0.23 S%, 26.99% SiO2 and 17.47% MgO. Of this,"												
52.8 Mt grading 27.02 %Fe Total and 0.23 %S has been reported as Measured and 54.6 Mt												
"grading 25.04 %Fe Total and 0.24 %S as Indicated. An additional, 24.7 Mt grading 24.58"												
%Fe Total and 0.23 %S has been reported as an Inferred Mineral Resource.												
Figure 15-9 shows the Whittle pit shell used to limit the Mineral Resource for Sahavaara												
and Figure 15-10 shows the Whittle pit shell used to limit the Mineral Resource for Tapuli.

"15.11	Mineral Reserve Statement"												
The Feasibility Study reports a Mineral Reserve for the project which based on the above												
"Mineral Resource Estimate. As is the case with the Mineral Resource, this has been reported"												
"using the CIM Code and is dated 18th May, 2011."												
"Specifically, SRK derived optimised pits for the Project based on the material reported as"												
Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources. The operating costs assumed for the												
optimisation were agreed between SRK and Northland while the metallurgical recoveries												
were provided by Bo Avidson Associates. Two separate designed pits were then developed												
"from the optimised pits, Tapuli and Sahavaara. Table 15-5 below presents the Mineral"												
Reserve estimate derived following this process.												
These tonnages have been based on a long term price forecast of 150c/dmtu. The tonnes and												
grades reported are undiluted and do not have a mining recovery factor applied. Given the												
"geometry of the ore lenses, SRK does not believe these to be material factors in this case."

PROPERTIES												
"16.1	Introduction"												
"This section presents the main conclusions given in the Feasibility Study, SRK’s comments"												
on these and also a Technical Economic Model (TEM) for the project. The latter is based												
primarily on the Feasibility Study but has been updated to reflect the current Business Plan												
developed by Northland in May 2011 which in turn reflects the most up to date estimates of												
capital costs and the construction status of the Project at that time.												
"16.2	Mine Design and Operation"												
"16.2.1	Pit Optimisation"												
Optimised pit shells were first generated in early 2010 using the Whittle Four-X software.												
A series of re-optimisations have been completed with several assumptions being revised by												
Northland. The revised input assumptions are:												
"•	Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources were used for the optimization. No"												
inferred material was included.												
"•	A flat iron price of 150 US0 per dry metric tonne unit (dmtu) was used, increased"												
from an initial price of 85 US0 per dmtu.												
"•	Mining costs based on initial discussions between Northland and SRK. These"												
"consisted of a base mining cost at a specified RL, and incremental costs to reflect the"												
"cost of hauling material up from below this level, or in some cases down to this level."												
"Using this method, the average mining cost for Tapuli was $1.55/t while the average"												
mining cost for Sahavaara was $2.02/t.												
"•	Metallurgical recoveries provided by Bo Arvidson Consulting LLC were applied"												
directly to the geological model.												
"•	The project general and administration cost (G&A) of 0.3 USD per ore tonne was"												
retained.												
"•	The original 2% royalty was corrected to 0.2%."												
"•	An overall pit wall slope angle of 49° for Tapuli based on the geotechnical review of"												
the Vattenfall report (Geotechnical Pit Slope Stability Analysis for the Tapuli Open												
Pit Mine - Phase 4: Slope Design) undertaken by SRK as part of its 2009												
Geotechnical review.												
"•	Overall pit wall slope angles of 48° (footwall) and 52° (hanging wall) for Sahavaara"												
based on the geotechnical assessment undertaken by SRK as part of its 2009												
Geotechnical review.

Common practice when choosing optimized shells is to choose the shell with the highest												
"cash flow. Typically this is the shell with a Revenue Factor of 1. However, it is also"												
"possible to choose a shell based on other factors, such as physical size, strip ratio or tonnage"												
output.												
"In this instance, the optimum shell has been based on a combination of factors including"												
"relative change in strip ratio, and ore content. The chosen pit for the Sahavaara deposit is pit"												
"shell 25 with a Revenue Factor of 0.78. For Tapuli, pit shell 31 with a Revenue Factor of"												
0.9 was chosen as the optimum shell. Figure 16-1 shows the nested pit shell statistics for												
"Sahavaara, while Figure 16-2 shows the same statistics for Tapuli."

The optimisation resulted in two open pits. Each pit was engineered for access and refined												
geotechnical parameters. The Tapuli pit contains 333.9Mt of material comprised of 94.5Mt												
of ore at a grade of 26.3% Fe and 239.4Mt of waste. The Sahavaara pit contains 373.1Mt of

the satellite pit to the northeast.												
Figure 16-10 to Figure 16-13 show the development of the Sahavaara engineered pit. This												
pit design allows for the possibility of in-pit dumping of waste after Stage 3 is complete.												
This has the effect of reducing trucking requirements.

Mine production scheduling was carried out on a bench by bench basis for all pit stages and												
was constrained by an ore mining rate of 6 Mtpa at each deposit and a maximum total												
movement of 70 Mtpa.												
"Prior to production commencing at each cutback within both deposits, the overburden will"												
need to be stripped. The schedule has been designed to ensure mine production is not												
affected by the overburden stripping operation. All cutbacks will be stripped prior to the												
commencement of mining operations.												
The project requires 12Mt of crusher feed per annum (combined from both deposits). The												
maximum total annual material movement for the Tapuli deposit is 28Mtpa. The maximum												
total material movement for the Sahavaara deposit is 42Mtpa.												
Figure 16-14 and Figure 16-15 below summarise the mine production schedule that has been												
developed.

"16.2.4	Mining Operations"												
"The pit design assumes a surface mine operation using drill and blasting operations, a mixed"												
fleet of tracked and wheel loading equipment and conventional haul trucks.												
"Drilling and blasting will be performed on 12m high benches, with blasted material"												
"excavated in a single pass. All of the mined material is planned to requiring blasting, except"												
for the thin layer of overburden. Planned grade control measures include blast hole												
sampling. Northland has indicated that these measures will be reviewed after the												
commencement of ore production to determine if any additional grade control measures are												
required.												
The haul roads have been designed to suit a Caterpillar 793D (228 t capacity) or equivalent												
dump truck with an operating width of 7.5m. A 30m wide dual lane ramp allows for a safe												
operating width of 2.5 truck widths plus windrows and drainage with single lane access for												
the last 36 vertical metres (3 benches) of depth in the pits. The ramp gradient has been												
designed at 10%.												
A minimum mining width of 100m has been assumed where possible to suit an excavator												
and 228t rigid body off-highway truck. This mining width allows cutbacks to progress												
without effecting productivity by mining smaller tight cutbacks. There will be sections of												
"each bench that are less than the designed minimum mining width, however these areas have"												
been minimised.												
A crushing station location has been designed close to the exit of each pit. Ore will be												
hauled by trucks to this crushing station and dumped. Material has been planned to be direct

tipped into the crusher without the need for a large Run of Mine (ROM) stockpile. A												
conveyor system will feed the material from the respective crushing station to a processing												
facility located adjacent to the Tapuli deposit.												
A small ROM stockpile has been planned adjacent to the crushing station at each pit to												
account for operational delays and minor crusher breakdowns. This stockpile will be												
utilised during the commissioning phase of the crushing and processing facility whilst the												
pit develops to a stage at which production can be maintained.												
"16.2.5	Labour"												
"The mine is planned to operate for 365 working days per year, with mining being carried out"												
on a rotating shift policy. A 5 panel shift pattern has been created that incorporates both 8												
hour and 12 hour shifts.												
"As part of each shift, Swedish labour laws indicate set times are required for meal and"												
fatigue breaks. These include:												
"•	Within an 8 hour shift, a minimum of 30 minutes must be set aside for meal break."												
"•	Within a 12 hour shift, a minimum of two, 30 minute periods must be set aside for"												
meal breaks.

"16.3	Metallurgical Testwork and Plant Design"												
"16.3.1	Background"												
Magnetite iron ore from the Tapuli and Sahavaara mines will be upgraded in a processing												
plant to be located at Kaunisvaara. Typically the Tapuli ore contains an average 26% Fe												
and 0.22% S and the Sahavaara ore approximately 41% Fe and 2.2% S. The predominant												
economic mineral in both deposits is magnetite. The Sahavaara ore also contains pyrrhotite												
which is weakly magnetic and reports with the magnetite and has to be removed from the												
concentrate by flotation.												
File Ref: P:\U4464 Kaunisvaara 43-101 Update\Project\Reps\43-101_Kaunisvaara_43101_June_2011 .Final.docx June 2011

Kaunisvaara 43-101												
Page 92												
The 12 Mtpa processing plant will comprise two streams. Stream 1 on the northern side of												
the plant will treat ore from the Tapuli mine and stream 2 on the southern side will treat ore												
from the Sahavaara mine. Each stream will be designed to treat 6 Mtpa of ore per year at a												
nominal processing rate of 761 tph. These streams will be similar and will operate												
"independently of each other with the exception of the plant utility systems (such as water,"												
"reagents and compressed air), the final tailings pumping system, the final concentrate"												
filtration system and the concentrate storage and truck load-out which will serve both												
streams.												
Over the LoM the total concentrate production will be similar from each open pit. The												
average yield over LoM will be approximately 35.9%. The overall grade of the magnetite												
"concentrate produced is approximately 69% Fe and will contain < 0.05% S, < 1% SiO2 and"												
< 2 to 3% MgO. The MgO figure is high compared to other concentrates on the market												
(typically 0.02 to 0.48% MgO) and consequently the concentrate will likely have to form												
part of a blended feed to either direct reduction or blast furnace operations.												
"16.3.2	Sahavaara Metallurgical Testwork"												
Samples												
Mineralogical studies have shown that most of the sulfur is present as monoclinic pyrrhotite												
and that relatively high levels of MgO are present in solid solution in the magnetite grains.												
The former could be removed by flotation whilst the latter cannot be removed by												
conventional beneficiation techniques. Concentrate produced from Sahavaara will therefore												
have to be blended with low MgO containing concentrates in downstream processing.												
Metallurgical Testwork												
Significant bench scale testwork and pilot scale testwork was performed on a number of												
large bulk samples of Sahavaara ore between 2005 and 2007. The results were positive but												
"the process required significant amounts of reagents in flotation, specifically sulfuric acid,"												
which made the flowsheet unattractive. Alternative grinding circuits were therefore												
considered.												
In 2008 a metallurgical drilling campaign produced 15 tonnes of material for definitive												
testwork on the Sahavaara deposit. The objectives of the testwork were to reduce acid												
"requirements, to establish the expected MgO content in the final concentrate from a more"												
"representative sample, and to simplify the flowsheet. The variability testing and the pilot"												
scale testing established the primary and secondary grind size and a flotation circuit that did												
not require high acid additions. Sulfur levels in final concentrate were acceptable and the												
MgO content was reduced considerably. The results formed the basis for the Feasibility												
Study.

"16.3.3	Tapuli Metallurgical Testwork"												
Samples												
The metallurgical samples used for the testwork have been collected from drillholes and												
from throughout the orebody. Pilot plant samples were made up from drill core selected by												
geologists to make a representative sample for testing.												
Iron is present predominantly in magnetite with a small amount contained in pyrrhotite.												
Metallurgical Testwork												
Testwork on drill core samples from the Tapuli deposit was first performed in 2007. The												
results were inconclusive and the proposed flowsheet was considered unrealistic.												
"In 2008, bench scale testing was performed on drill core samples followed by pilot testing"												
on 24 tonnes of drill core selected to make a representative sample of the Tapuli resource												
model available at that time. The testwork demonstrated that an acceptable product could be												
"achieved using three stage crushing, ball milling and low intensity magnetic separation"												
(LIMS).												
"In 2009, a 4 tonne sample was composited from drill core for further variability and pilot"												
plant testing. The sample contained material from high sulfur areas which was subsequently												
eliminated from the resource. The variability testing demonstrated that the high sulfur												
material was detrimental and that if it were eliminated from the feed an acceptable												
concentrate could be produced using LIMS only without flotation. The pilot results												
confirmed the fine grind of 80% passing 32 microns was required to achieve an acceptable												
concentrate quality. The metallurgical results were used for the Feasibility Study.												
Primary Grinding Testwork												
"JKTech Drop Weight Testing (DWT), SAG Power Index testing, MacPherson grinding"												
testwork and Bond tests were performed on Sahavaara ore during the initial testing of												
Sahavaara material in 2007.												
Further DWT was performed on a sample of Sahavaara ore composited from seven drill												
holes taken across the orebody. The sample is considered to be harder than the average ore												
that will be fed to the grinding circuit. The test programme and the results were discussed												
with the potential mill suppliers and the model developed was used for the primary mill												
design.												
DWT was performed on a sample of Tapuli ore. The results were discussed with the												
potential mill suppliers and used for the primary mill design.

Secondary Grinding testwork												
10 kg samples of both Tapuli and Sahavaara wet cobbing concentrate were tested by Metso												
to determine the Vertimill specific grinding energy requirements. Grinding from 80%												
passing 300microns to 80% passing 32 microns the specific energy requirements (Vertimill)												
were 17.31kWh/t for Tapuli and 16.71kWh/t for Sahavaara.												
"16.3.4	Metallurgical Recovery Functions"												
The recovery function developed for the Tapuli ore body is based on the variability testwork												
results and is shown in Figure 16-17. Following the pilot testing a correction factor of												
0.9643 was used to adjust the calculated recoveries to match those achieved on the pilot												
plant. The range of % Fe and % S in the Tapuli ROM feed from the mining plan fall within												
the envelope of the recovery function data and consequently SRK considers that the												
"predicted recoveries for Tapuli used in the financial modelling, based on the applied"												
"recovery function with adjustment, are a good representation of the performance that should"												
be achieved on the plant.												
The recovery function developed for the Sahavaara ore body is more complicated. Areas												
within the orebody will be mined which contain mineralisation with relatively high levels of												
sulfur. The testwork indicated that this material has a detrimental effect on iron recovery												
"and yield. Regression of the testwork results gave a relatively poor fit. However, these"												
"problematic ore zones constitute a relatively small portion of the Sahavaara ore body, which"												
"means that on an average quarterly basis, the RoM head grades of both Fe% and S% will fall"												
"within a reasonably narrow range, for which a realistic function can be developed. This"												
situation is further improved by RoM blending prior to the concentrator. The regression of												
testwork data that falls within this envelope of these RoM feed grades is more satisfactory												
"and is shown in Figure 16-18. SRK considers that, based on a blended feed, the predicted"												
recoveries for Sahavaara used in the financial modelling using this applied recovery												
"function, are a good representation of the likely results that should be achieved."

"16.3.6	Pelletizing Tests"												
Laboratory pelletizing tests were performed by Studiengesellschaft fur Eisenerzaufbereitung												
(SGA) in June 2010 on a concentrate sample produced by Northland. The general												
conclusions were:												
"•	In all cases the green ball strengths were satisfactory;"												
"•	The average pellet crush strength according to ISO 4700 was well above the"												
acceptable standards of 300 dN/P;												
"•	The pellets all fulfilled the requirements of the tumble test (ISO 3271);"												
"•	The reduction under load test (ISO7992) was acceptable;"												
"•	The swelling index (ISO 4698) was acceptable with a volume increase of 13.7 to"												
16.0%;												
"•	The results of the low temperature dynamic test (ISO 13930) were mixed, a low"												
disintegration strength with favourable metallurgical properties;												
"•	The reducibility was highly favourable for all pellets (ISO 7992)."												
SGA states that the challenging property of the Northland pellets is disintegration strength												
but this slight deficiency is compensated by the good physical and chemical properties and												
by the perfect results for reduction under load. Overall SGA concludes that the study												
proved that pellets produced from Northland concentrate should be well accepted by the												
market.												
"16.3.7	Transportable Moisture Limit (TML)"												
The TML for both Tapuli and Sahavaara concentrates have been determined by Boliden												
Minerals AB using a standard Proctor test and are achievable by the proposed filtration												
plant.												
"16.3.8	Process Route"												
"The processing facilities have been sized to treat 12 Mtpa of ore from two open pits, Tapuli"												
and Sahavaara. The concentrator is split in to two streams each designed to treat 6Mtpa ore												
"and produce a magnetite concentrate with nominally 69% Fe content. Stream 1, which will"												
"come on line first, has been designed based on the Tapuli metallurgy. Stream 2 will treat"												
ore from Sahavaara which involves metallurgy that is slightly more complicated due to the												
presence of weakly magnetic pyrrhotite which has to be removed from the magnetite												
concentrate.												
The target marketable concentrate grades are approximately 69% Fe and less than 0.05% S.												
The selected process route for both the Tapuli and Sahavaara ore bodies includes the												
following unit processes: •												
"•	Primary crushing (at each	pit)"												
"•	Blending stockpiles"												
"•	Primary milling"

"•	Primary magnetic separation (cobbing)"												
"•	Secondary grinding"												
"•	Secondary magnetic separation (LIMS)"												
"•	Reverse flotation of sulphides (Sahavaara only)"												
"•	Magnetite concentrate dewatering (LIMS) - Sahavaara only"												
"•	Magnetite concentrate filtration (common to both streams)"												
"•	Final concentrate storage and truck loadout (common to both streams)"												
"•	Coarse tailings classification"												
"•	Fine tailings thickening"												
The selected process route generally reflects the testwork findings for both Tapuli and												
Sahavaara ores. The design basis for the plant is reasonable and results in a realistic plant												
design.												
Process design and equipment sizing incorporates satisfactory design margins to												
accommodate likely feed variations.												
The stockpiles have a live capacity of 2 days and a total capacity of 7 to 8 days. This will												
allow sufficient feed blending prior to the concentrator.												
The stockpile feed conveying systems includes cross over conveyors which would allow												
crushed ore from either pit to be fed in to either of the process streams. This would allow												
any high sulfur feed from Tapuli to be processed in the Sahavaara process stream which												
incorporates flotation for removal of sulphides from the magnetite concentrate.												
Separation of coarse lumps or ore for use as AG mill charge has been incorporated in to the												
stockpile design and is satisfactory.												
The primary mill circuit design and mill design allows the mills to operate in either fully												
autogenous or semi-autogenous modes. The mills are geared with a dual pinion and have												
been selected after an evaluation of gearless versus geared drives. Drop Weight Testing has												
been performed and the data has been used by recognised mill suppliers to size the primary												
grinding equipment. The mills are identical for each stream and the mill shell and drive												
train have been sized for the worst case scenario (in terms of power draw) for operating as a												
SAG mill with 10% steel charge. Since it is anticipated that the mills should be able to												
operate in autogenous mode the installed power represents about 30% margin above the												
anticipated power draw required. In addition the grinding circuit layout incorporates space												
for retrofitting pebble recirculation and crushing should this prove necessary.

The final grind required is 80% passing 32 microns and vertical stirred mills have been												
incorporated in to the circuit design. The mill sizing has been based on industry accepted												
"testwork. The proposed mills would be the largest manufactured, installed power 3,000HP"												
"or 2,250 kW. The first project that will use mills of this size is reported to start-up by the"												
end of 2010. This is not considered a significant risk but it would be prudent to monitor any												
start-up and operational issues prior to placing any orders.												
Flotation has been incorporated in to the Sahavaara flowsheet due to magnetic sulphides												
reporting with the magnetite and the design is considered to be conservative. Space has												
been left in the concentrator for installation of similar flotation equipment in the Tapuli												
circuit at a later date if required.												
Product filtration is common for both streams. Filter sizing is based on vendor testwork and												
requires six filters operating at maximum production. The vendors have identified a												
potential problem with the lower temperatures that may be experienced in which case an												
additional filter may be required. The production ramp up and the staged stream 1 and 2												
start-up will allow the filtration circuit capacity to be assessed and if required an additional												
filter ordered before full production capacity is achieved. The layout incorporates space for												
an additional filter should this prove necessary.												
Filtered concentrate will be stored in the covered concentrate load out area and will be												
loaded in to 124 tonne road trains by large front end loaders. Loading will operate 24 hours												
"per day, 7 days per week and a satisfactory traffic management system will be required to"												
safely control the large number of trucks entering and leaving the site.												
"The proposed plant design incorporates adequate process control, metallurgical on-stream"												
analysis and sampling equipment.												
"16.3.9	Production Ramp-up"												
The Tapuli process stream will come on line 18months before the Sahavaara stream. The												
mine plan allows approximately 6 months ramp-up to full production tonnage for each												
stream. SRK considers the assumed ramp-up schedule to be reasonable.												
"16.3.10	Capital Costs"												
The capital cost for the dual stream concentrator has been estimated by Jacobs using normal												
"engineering and estimating methods. The estimate has been built up in multiple currencies,"												
predominantly USD and EUR for imported equipment and SEK for locally supplied												
equipment or services. The latter represents 51% of the total costs. The estimate accuracy is												
"quoted as +/- 15%. The estimated capital cost, excluding any contingency is 379.9 million"												
USD and the detail is presented in Table 16-4.

Equipment costs have been based on multiple quotations from international suppliers.												
"Where appropriate, costs for minor items of equipment have been based on in-house prices."												
The mechanical equipment cost assumed by the Feasibility Study incorporates a 5%												
"discount, for good buying of equipment."												
"Detailed material take-offs have been prepared for all bulk items such as concrete, piping"												
"and valves, electrics etc and have been costed using market rates obtained by multiple"												
quotations. The unit rates have been reviewed against the contractor’s in-house database												
and are considered reasonable.												
"Similarly, installation costs have been based on quotations from multiple in country"												
contractors using the estimated quantities and work scope prepared by the engineer.												
EPCM costs have been estimated by the contractor from first principles based on in-house												
experience. Commissioning costs have been excluded as the two streams will be brought on												
"line at separate times and the client approach, in terms of owner’s team versus contractor"												
"assistance for commissioning, has not been finalised."												
SRK considers that the amount of engineering performed for estimation of the work												
"required is acceptable, and the capital cost developed is realistic. A 10% contingency has"												
been included by SRK in its financial analysis presented later in this section.												
"16.3.11	Process Plant Implementation Schedule"												
The implementation schedule prepared by Jacobs reflects the phased development of the												
Tapuli process stream followed by the Sahavaara stream. Both streams will be housed in the												
same building. The Tapuli plant will be mechanically complete 26 months after contract												
award and plant commissioning and ramp up will be completed after an additional 6 months.												
The Sahavaara processing stream will be fully operational 18 months after the Tapuli												
"stream. A detailed implementation plan for engineering, procurement and construction will"												
be required to reflect phased procurement and delivery of equipment and materials for												
stream 1 and 2 and to identify the safe methodology to be used to enable the Tapuli plant to												
operate as a production unit while the Sahavaara plant is being constructed.												
Site works for the process plant construction are due to start in Q2 of 2011.												
SRK considers that the schedule as presented for the implementation of the processing												
facilities at Kaunisvaara to be achievable.												
"16.3.12	Conclusions and Recommendations"												
The testwork has demonstrated the metallurgy for both the Tapuli and Sahavaara deposits												
and the selected process route is considered by SRK to be appropriate for the two ore												
bodies.												
Sufficient engineering has been performed to establish the plant capital cost assuming a												
contingency of 10%.

The implementation schedule and the plant ramp up time for both Tapuli and Sahavaara												
streams is considered realistic. The potential effect of weather windows on the overall												
schedule should be reassessed if the project start date changes significantly.												
"16.4	Infrastructure"												
"16.4.1	Power"												
The initial power requirement will be 33MW when Tapuli comes on stream during												
September 2013 but this will increase to 63MW when Sahavaara comes on stream during												
October 2014.												
Power for the operation will be supplied from the Swedish national grid. It is assumed that												
the supply to Kaunisvaara will be undertaken by the Swedish electrical supply commission												
at no capital cost to Northland. The incoming supply is 130kV and is stepped down to 10 kV												
for site distribution with two 50MVA transformers. This will enable all essential equipment												
and one production stream to operate during unplanned outages of one transformer. The												
installation of a third transformer could be considered to give full standby in the event of												
one transformer being out of service.												
Power for the Muonio River pump station will have a separate supply from existing												
infrastructure.												
The power supply for the project has been developed in some detail and although adequate												
for the operation does not take into consideration future expansion needs. While this is not												
considered to be an impediment to the current proposed operation it may impact adversely												
"on the viability of future expansions. Agreements regarding installations, possible capital"												
costs and operating costs are being negotiated with the Swedish electrical supply												
commission.												
"16.4.2	Potable Water Supply"												
It is proposed that potable water supply to Kaunisvaara and Tapuli mine will be provided by												
boreholes to be drilled in the vicinity. The required depth of the boreholes to be drilled at												
Kaunisvaara is still the subject of investigation but the depth at Tapuli is assumed to be												
between 20 and 50 m. A storage tank will be constructed at ground level from where it will												
be pumped to the distribution system. Potable water at the Sahavaara mine will be supplied												
from the Sahavaara village’s water works via a pipeline of approximately 2.8 km.												
"16.4.3	Sewage and Waste Water Disposal"												
Waste water at the Kaunisvaara and Tapuli operations will be treated at a waste water												
treatment plant. This will consist of a septic tank and filtration and purification systems.												
There is also the possibility to add chlorine to the purified water if considered necessary.												
The purified waste water will then be pumped to the process water plant. The waste water												
from the Sahavaara operation does not contain sewage as it is proposed to use dry latrines												
and dispose of the grey water into the soil.

"16.4.4	Roads"												
"The construction of the roads has to consider the ground conditions in the area, which have"												
not as yet been fully investigated and so are currently conceptual in nature. The ground												
conditions in the area are known to have fairly deep peat layers and this could impact on the												
"estimated design and costs of the construction of the roads, although this has been"												
considered in the proposed road designs and reasonable assumptions have been made in this												
determination. The designs of the roads are substantial with the sub structure varying from												
4m to 2m deep. The access road will be sealed with asphalt and the others sealed with												
compacted crushed rock.												
The roads included in the project are:-												
"•	Access road (~2km)"												
"•	Service roads"												
"•	Dumper roads"												
"16.4.5	Buildings"												
Due to the cold winter conditions most of the facilities will be housed in appropriate heated												
"buildings. The site selected for the process plant is in an elevated position, in the vicinity of"												
"Kaunisvaara, to avoid building in marshy conditions. Preliminary geotechnical studies have"												
been carried in this area and it is believed that the ground conditions in this area will not												
require piling.												
The buildings will consist of the following.												
"•	Two process plant buildings"												
"•	Two stockpile buildings"												
"•	Administration building"												
"•	Workshops and truck bays"												
"•	Stores building"												
"•	Metallurgical laboratory"												
"•	Plant services building"												
"•	Two pump station buildings"												
"•	Assay laboratory"												
"The total floor space estimated for the buildings amounts to 23,790m2. The buildings will be"												
insulated and heated where considered necessary. The method of heating the process												
"building would be to utilize the heat from air compressors and other operational plant, with"												
an electric boiler for use in times of non operation of the plant. The information reviewed												
indicates that the heating aspect is still conceptual; however the proposed extent of buildings												
and the structure appear adequate for the operation of the mine.												
The process plant building will be built in two phases with a partition between to enable the												
first phase to commence operation while the second phase is under construction. This												
partition will be removed once the second phase is completed.

"16.4.6	Communications"												
Communications in the area are reported to be fairly well developed and a sophisticated												
system of communications for the operation is planned. A data network using fibre optic												
cable distribution is planned together with radio communication for mobile equipment												
operations. The proposed communication systems are considered to be adequate for the												
operation.												
"16.4.7	Security"												
"Provision has been made for the installation of perimeter fencing, security lighting, access"												
control and a gatehouse at the site access point. Access points are monitored with CCTV.												
The provisions for security are considered adequate and suitable for the operation.												
"16.4.8	Concentrate Logistics"												
It is proposed that the process plant will be built in two phases. The first will cater for ore												
"from the Tapuli open pit mine and the second phase will treat ore from Sahavaara, which"												
will come on stream 18 months later. This will not have a major bearing on development												
and construction of the logistics facilities for the concentrates as the concept and route will												
have to be established for the total maximum production of 5.0MTPA.												
It was initially proposed to transport the concentrate to the port of Kemi in Finland. This												
was considered to be more expensive to operate as the port can handle vessels up to												
"approximately 50,000 tonnes against the Narvik port capacity to handle vessels of 300,000"												
tonnes.												
A decision has now been taken to export concentrates through the port of Narvik in Norway.												
This will entail road transport from Kaunisvaara to Svappavaara and from there by existing												
rail to the port of Narvik. A study has been carried out by Norconsult on the practicalities of												
"using this route which encompassed alternative solutions for terminal constructions, cost"												
"assessments, time estimations for constructions, risk assessments, schedule for planning,"												
designing and permitting processes.No major impediments have been highlightedregarding												
"this aspect of the project, which is crucial to the viability of the project. Northland intends to"												
establish a Joint Venture company with interested parties to develop and manage the												
logistics infrastructure for the transportation of concentrates. Although further negotiations												
"are required to establish the Joint Venture company, this approach will eliminate from the"												
"project budget the capital required for a fleet of road trucks, railway wagons, train engines"												
and the capital required to develop the load out station at Svappavaara and the port												
infrastructure at Narvik. The development of those facilities will be undertaken by the joint												
venture. It is also proposed that the Joint Venture will enter into lease agreements for the												
supply of trucks and railway wagons. The joint venture will fund this development with a												
mixture of equity from within the Joint Venture and external financing.

"16.4.9	Load out Station"												
"It is proposed to load out from storage buildings, each with a capacity of 1400 tons, on"												
either side of the filter building of the process plant on to road trains consisting of a truck												
and two trailers with a haul capacity of 104 tonnes and an overall length of 37 meters. This												
"will be done using front end loaders possibly Volvo L350F or equivalent, with a bucket"												
capacity of 15 tonnes. The loading will take place in a drive through loading bay. Loading												
will be required to reach an hourly rate of 600tonnes. This will require a reliable operation												
and adequate machines to maintain the required load out rate and ensure that a suitable												
maintenance schedule can be accommodated.												
"16.4.10	Road Transport"												
It is currently envisaged that trucks will be required to transport the concentrate from												
"Kaunisvaara to Svappavaara, a distance of 150km, on existing 9 meter wide road"												
infrastructure. Several road routes from Kaunisvaara to Sahavaara have been investigated in												
detail and the option UA5 has been selected as the the most suitable route for the												
transportation of concentrates from Kaunisvaara to Svappavaara.												
There are several restrictions identified at this stage and possible solutions considered.												
"Generally they are related to tight bends, built - up areas and bridges. The road trains will"												
have a capacity of 104 tonnes and a length of 37 metersand have a capacity of 70 tons of												
concentrate. There is the long term future possibility of using trucks with a loaded weight of												
"170 tons, however a permit from the Swedish Transport Authorities is required for this"												
operation and the size of vehicles utilised will depend on the outcome of those negotiations.												
"No permit is required for 60 ton trucks, but this is not favourable to the Swedish Transport"												
Association or to Northland and it is probable that a consession to use larger vehicles will be												
given. The route does go through some built up areas and there is a possibility that there will												
need to be some road upgrades and deviations to avoid the bottlenecks that have been												
identified. The condition of the road between Kaunisvaara and Svappavaara has been												
"assessed by Roadscanners, a specialist company who have established that the road will"												
need to be upgraded to handle the iron ore trucks transporting the concentrates and initial												
estimations are that this will cost in the region of US$50m. The road falls under the Roadex												
Project which is an EU sponsored Project to upgrade the Northern Periphery road networks												
"of Finland, Scotland, Norway and Sweden."												
The round trip for one truck is estimated to take 5 hours 8 minutes and the loading time of												
13 minutes.

"16.4.11	Rail Transport"												
The existing Malmbanan railway runs from Svappavaara to the port of Narvik in Norway.												
The distance is approximately 226kms. A study has been carried out for Northland by												
Vectura which reports that there is capacity at current traffic rates to transport the initial												
"loading from Svappavaara to the port of Narvik, without upgrading the railway"												
infrastructure although there would need to be some rescheduling of the current traffic to												
meet Northland’s needs. Future expansion of the railway is being considered by both the												
Swedish and Norwegian railway authorities to cater for increased future demands.The road												
transport will discharge the concentrate onto stockpiles from where it will be loaded onto the												
railway wagons by front end loaders. The wagons and railway engines will be managed by												
the Joint Venture Company who will enter into a lease agreement with the suppliers.												
"16.4.12	Port Facilities and ship loading"												
A review of the port relative to Northland’s project needs was carried out by Norconsult. A												
new port terminal will be needed to support the full production of the Project. This will take												
longer to construct than the time it will take to complete the mining and process facilities. It												
is therefore apparent that a temporary facility will be needed until the new facility is												
"available. The temporary facility ,which is situated at an under utilised container terminal at"												
"Fagernes in the port area of Narvik, will have a permit for 10 years and thereafter the port"												
authority will either allocate a new area at Grundstadsvik where a new load out facility will												
be constructed utilising existing material handling equipment or renew the permit for the												
existing facility.												
The port facility which will need to be established for the temporary site at Fagernes has												
been designed to the extent that a definitive capital estimate has been produced. Various												
options were considered for the port arrangement and the decision has been made to build a												
"jetty capable of handling vessels up to 180,000 tons and loaded with a radial shiploader."												
Although the geotechnical investigations have not yet been completed the design allows for												
piles to be driven to a depth of 40 meters. SRK considers this to be a reasonable assumption.												
A de-icing plant will be required to thaw the railway wagons on arrival.												
"16.4.13	Conclusions - Concentrate Transport"												
Northland has investigated several possibilities for the transportation of the iron ore												
concentrates and selected the most favourable options for further investigation. The options												
selected have been developed to a reasonable degree of detail enabling an estimate to be												
produced that has a degree of confidence that is suitable for the DFS. There are still some												
areas of risk that have been identified and are being investigated further. These are:												
"1.	The timing of the road upgrade from Kaunisvaara to Svappavaara."												
"2.	The successful testing of the offloading of the rail wagons."												
"3.	The ground conditions for the construction of the quay at Fagernes."												
"4.	A satisfactory conclusion to the negotiations to form a Joint Venture Company and"												
lease agreements for trucks and rolling stock.

The main tailings pond is designed as a central tailings discharge facility with an adjacent												
"clarification pond as shown in Figure 16-10 above Tailings, Sahavaara and Tapuli blended,"												
will be pumped from the process plant to the TMF in two tailings pipelines and one												
additional in reserve. The pipelines are placed on a supporting structure of crushed rock next												
to the industrial road. Tailings discharge takes place in the center of the facility using a												
"spigotting arrangement of four pipes which alternate two and two, allowing flexible"												
discharge all around the facility.												
"The perimeter containment structure of the TMF will consist of a till embankment, overlain"												
"by a layer of crushed aggregate, which will act as the service road (Figure 16-20). Around"												
"the water clarification pond, the embankment will be composed of a moraine upstream core,"												
surrounded by blasted rock material for erosion protection.

"16.5.2	Geotechnical Site investigation"												
Geotechnical drilling at the site was completed by WSP from January to March 2010. The												
investigation included borehole ram sounding at 50 points with collection of 45 samples. In												
"addition, the site investigation included 16 km of Ground Penetration Radar, which was"												
"performed by MRM. Due to changes of the footprint of the TMF, the site investigation has"												
not covered the entire subject area. Sufficient area has been covered in the site investigation												
to accurately characterise the site for feasibility level investigation.												
The results from the site investigation showed that the subject area is covered by a peat												
"layer, which varies in thickness from 0 to 4 meters. Beneath this horizon, the substrate"												
consists predominantly of glacial till and sand deposits.												
"16.5.3	TMF and clarification pond capacity"												
"The total storage capacity of the TMF is estimated at 117 Mt, consisting of 65 Mt of tailings"												
"waste from Tapuli, 41 Mt of waste from Sahavaara, plus a contingency capacity of 11 Mt."												
The total footprint of the CTD facility will be 4.1 km2 with the adjacent clarification pond												
"amounting to 1.53 km2. The total volume of the clarification pond will be 2 500,000 m3."												
"16.5.4	TMF design criteria"												
Tailings will be thickened to a solids content of 50 % by weight and deposited from the												
centre of the TMF. It is expected that the tailings beach will be deposited above the water												
line at all times and it will form a slope varying from 2 to 4 %. Depending on the deposition												
"angles, the final elevation of the TMF could vary between +198 and +214 m above sea"												
level.												
A series of possible designs for co-disposal of these tailings streams was initially based on												
"preliminary geochemical tests identified (Eriksson, 2009). Sahavaara tailings have a"												
significantly higher sulfur content (2.95 % in the wet cobbing / low intensity magnetic												
"separation tailings and 10.3 % in the cleaning flotation tailings), than the Tapuli tailings"												
(0.33%). Sahavaara tailings are therefore potentially acid generating.

The base case placement strategy will consist of depositing non acid generating Tapuli												
"tailings at the base, then blending all tailings (Tapuli and Sahavaara) as a mixture (average"												
1.79% sulfur). Should additional geochemical testing prove that this configuration remains												
"potential acid generating, Poyry have prepared and alternative deposition strategy which"												
"allows for selective deposition of the flotation tailings in one section of the TMF, before"												
"continuously overlapping with a blend of Sahavaara and Tapuli tailings, then finally Tapuli"												
tailings.												
Tapuli tailings at the base of the structure will function as an acid buffer zone. The												
"attenuation capacity of this zone, combined with that of the residual peat substrate will"												
"ensure that no acidic fluids interact with the local groundwater regime. In addition, the"												
TMF is situated on a wetland zone which functions as a “flow out area” towards the												
clarification pond. For these reasons and the TMF will not be lined at the base.												
The TMF footprint has been determined based on 4 % beach slope and unit density of 1.64												
"t/m3 (combined tailings, volume 71.3 Mm3). The overall beach slope has also studied for 2"												
% beach slope as a possible case with consequences to the embankment structures and												
relating costs. Should the beach slope angle be lower than the 4% included in the preferred												
"design, this will incur additional costs as the overall capacity of the facility will have to be"												
higher.												
In order to ensure a sufficiently high factor of safety is achieved for foundations stability.												
the peat horizon from below the service road will be excavated to a maximum depth of 2 m.												
"To enable relocation of the tailings discharge point to the centre of the TMF, a spigot access"												
"road is required. The road will be initially built of blasted rock. As the tailings level rises,"												
the spigot road will also be raised accordingly. Subsequent raises will be composed of												
"tailings material, assuming sufficient drainage has occurred. Otherwise run of mine waste"												
rock shall be utilized. Tailings discharge pipelines will run alongside the service road and												
will be gradually raised in tandem.												
"16.5.5	Design of Clarification Pond"												
Residual water from the deposited tailings will drain into the clarification pond. There will												
"be an interim embankment separating the pond and the CDT areas, which prevents tailings"												
from flowing into the pond. This will consist of a fine moraine core with rockfill protection												
layers on both the upstream and downstream sides (See Figure 16-2 below) Final												
embankment crest width will be 5m.												
"16.5.6	Embankment Design"												
The clarification pond embankment will consist of a zoned earthfill dam with a moraine												
core. Between the blasted rock and moraine core a 500 mm thick filter zone will be installed												
(Figure 16-12). This will consist of aggregate fill (0 to 100 mm dia). The filter zone has												
been designed to prevent internal erosion. In addition a filter cloth will be installed between												
the moraine core and filter zone. The upper end of the cloth will extend to the high water												
level.

The length of the clarification pond dam is approximately 3 500m with a maximum height												
of 5.1m. An emergency spillway has also been installed to facilitate drainage from the												
pond.												
Slope inclination on the downstream slope will be 1V:2H and on the upstream slope will be												
1V:2.5H. The designed slope of the upstream face has been stipulated to ensure adequate												
stability is achieved in case of rapid water table drawdown from the HW-level.												
The western embankments around the tailings area will consist of upstream raised waste												
rock and till embankments as per Figure 16-22 below:

"16.5.7	Stability calculations"												
The dam stability of the clarification pond has been calculated for three cases:												
"1.	Rapid drawdown;"												
"2.	Steady state seepage;"												
"3.	Extreme situation: phreatic line is determined assuming the dam is homogenous."												
Stability calculations have been performed using the Slide software; Bishop Janbu circle												
shaped sliding surfaces. Results of stability analyses have confirmed that the factor of safety												
is adequate in all circumstances.

"16.5.8	Seepage Calculations"												
"Seepage calculations have been made in 2D cross sections, calculated with FEM software"												
using average soil layer thicknesses and hydraulic conductivities. No liner installation has												
been considered at the base of the TMF.												
"There are thick, high permeability sand layers under the TMF that cannot be completely"												
"sealed. Thereby seepage through the sand layer is anticipated, which under normal"												
circumstances would lead to internal erosion at the base of the TMF. A nominal layer of												
moraine has been included at the base of the TMF to prevent this occurrence.												
"16.5.9	TMF Closure Concept"												
A number of guiding closure principles have been worked out for the TMF as listed below:												
"•	There will be no significant, physical off-site impacts."												
"•	Baseline surface water quality in recipients will be maintained (unless directly"												
physically affected).												
"•	The established vegetative cover within the site shall be self-sustaining and with time"												
show progression towards the surrounding undisturbed vegetation in terms of species												
diversity and plant density.												
"•	The post-mining landforms will be stable and respond to erosive forces in a similar"												
"manner to equivalent landforms occurring naturally within the area (e.g. slopes,"												
undulating hills).												
"•	There will remain no unsafe areas where members of the public (or wildlife) could"												
"inadvartedly, or at least not without exceptional effort, gain access."												
"•	Final landform designs will be similar to the existing regional landforms, within the"												
constraints imposed by the physical nature of the materials and the additional cost												
necessary.												
"The end land uses for the areas are to be determined in consultation with stakeholders, and"												
signed off with the administering authority during the life of the operations. Based on these												
"assumptions a number of preferred alternatives have been established, which are outlined in"												
"the closure plan (Golder, 2010). The preferred alternative assumes that Tapuli tailings are"												
deposited initially to form a base layer in the TMF. This is followed by combined tailings												
discharge for the duration of the life of Sahavaara operation. During the final years of the												
TMF only Tapuli tailings would be deposited. In this way the potentially acid forming												
Sahavaara tailings would be encapsulated (refer to Section 16.7.4 for more information on												
the geochemical characterisation of the tailings material).												
"16.5.10	Conclusions and Recommendations"												
The Kaunisvaara TMF has been designed as a CTD facility to overcome the environmental												
constraints presented by the selected site for development. This design assumes the tailings												
will be discharged from the central portion of the facility towards the outer perimeter. No												
"water will be stored within the tailings portion of facility, with slurry water conveyed"												
directly to the clarification pond.

The central discharge scheme could however involve different types of operational risks												
associated with winter operation. These risks are summarized as follows:												
"1.	Slumping may occur within particular sections of the tailings beach due to"												
freeze/thaw cycles throughout the year. This process will affect the overall beach												
"angle, thus resulting in reduced capacity for tails storage. Higher containment"												
embankments may be required as result of these local failures within the facility;												
"2.	There may be difficulties in achieving the design beach angles, which could result in"												
additional operational costs due to higher raises of TMF containment. The central												
discharge scheme may create problems with direction control of beach deposition.												
More dozer and other operational work may be required to control beach areas;												
"3.	There could be issues regarding water return to the clarification pond in winter"												
months due to freezing of the area conveying the water (ditches around the facility).												
A winter water return system should be designed to alleviate this issue.												
The capital costs of the TMF were calculated assuming an optimum 4 % beach slope angle												
for capacity calculations. Should the tailings slope angle prove to be lower once production												
"commences, then these costs could increase. This issue should therefore be examined"												
further during detailed design.												
The TMF should operate effectively as planned providing the overall design is further												
"improved and field-fitted where necessary. In addition, a detailed construction management"												
plan must be prepared for the commissioning and operational phase works of the project.												
"16.6	Waste Rock Dump"												
The primary waste rock dump storage facility at the Kaunisvaara mining operation includes												
"two dumps: Tapuli and Sahavaara. The engineering design, including preliminary capital"												
cost estimate (CAPEX) for the dumps has been performed by SRK Consulting (UK).												
The waste rock dump storage facility was designed as part of the October 2010 study and												
"has not been updated with recent changes to the mining schedule. That said, the current plan"												
mines less waste than the October 2010 study and as it stands the current waste rock dump												
"design and capacity criteria are therefore still valid and robust. Notwithstanding this, it is"												
recognised that the waste rock dump storage facility aspects of the study may benefit from												
an update to match the current mining schedule and that this may result in certain cost												
"savings. These are unlikely, however, to be material to the project as a whole."

"The total tonnage of the waste (soil and rock) to be stored, as based on the October 2010"												
study was calculated at 300Mt and 400Mt for the Tapuli and Sahavaara pits respectively.												
The recent update to the mining schedule shows that the total tonnage of (soil and rock) to												
"be stored is calculated at 240Mt and 303Mt for the Tapuli and Sahavaara pits respectively,"												
this being a reduction in 60Mt and 97Mt respectively. Table 16-5 shows the waste storage												
requirements for Tapuli and Sahavaara based on the updated mining schedule. As shown the												
current dump capacity is well in excess of the current requirements.

"These capacity calculations are based on a swell factor of 1.2, which represents the"												
minimum acceptable bulking factor for placement of waste rock. As the waste rock dumps												
"will be constructed on a greenfield site, it is not currently known what the exact bulking"												
factor will be. SRK has estimated as a worst case scenario this could be as high as 1.32.												
"Based on the updated mining schedule, both waste dumps have capacity to store the"												
potential volume increase with no deficit being calculated for both dumps.SRK recommends												
that operating costs are adjusted according to the measured bulking factor as soon as the												
data is available.												
"16.6.2	Dump Design Criteria"												
The following waste dump design criteria is based on the October 2010 study. It is												
recommended that the design criteria be updated to match the current mining schedule.												
The general dump parameters are as follows:												
Tapuli WRD												
"•	2.69km2 footprint surface area;"												
"•	2,650m length;"												
"•	1,515m width;"												
"•	two 7m lifts, two 10m lifts, one 20m lift and one 21m lift to a maximum height of"												
75m;												
"•	overall slope angle of 18.4° (1V:3H) from toe to crest;"												
"•	operational bench slope angle of 33° (1V:1.5H);"												
"•	closure bench slope angle of 26.8° (1V:2H);"												
Sahavaara WRD												
"•	3.11 km2 footprint surface area;"												
"•	2,830 m length;"												
"•	1775 m width (maximum);"

"•	two 7m lifts, two 10m lifts, one 20m lift and one 21m lift to a maximum height of"												
75m;												
"•	overall slope angle of 18.4° (1V:3H) from toe to crest;"												
"•	operational bench slope angle of 33° (1V:1.5H);"												
"•	closure bench slope angle of 26° (1V:2H);"												
"16.6.3	Geotechnical Site investigation"												
Details of the geotechnical site investigation are contained within the Phase 3 WRD report												
"(SRK, 2010). This consisted of the following:"												
"•	Ground penetrating radar surveys were carried out in both the WRD areas, across a"												
total of four transects totaling 7.4km length.												
"•	Trial pitting was carried out at 40 locations (19 at Sahavaara and 21 at Tapuli). Pits"												
were excavated to 5.0m depth or refusal using a 16T caterpillar excavator.												
"•	Auger drilling was carried out at 18 locations using a three tonne track-mounted drill"												
rig with 8.0cm diameter solid stem auger.												
"The site investigation also included an extensive laboratory program, which included peat"												
and till strength and consolidation testing.												
The results from the site investigation infer that both sites are predominantly underlain by												
"Quaternary age decomposed, amorphous peat, which covers the majority of the low lying"												
areas at both Sahavaara and Tapuli. This material is generally saturated year round and												
remains unfrozen during the winter months. During loading of the peat material by waste												
"rock, the consolidation of the peat was noted to be high, being in the order of 30%."												
"16.6.4	Design of Dumps"												
Based upon observations of the behaviour of the peat substrate at similar operations in the												
"region, Northland has requested SRK to devise adump development strategy that does not"												
"involve peat stripping around the specified zones, as outlined in the Kaunisvaara WRD"												
"Feasibility Report (SRK, 2010). Utilisation of this method, as outlined in the WRD"												
"Addendum Report (SRK, 2010f) will result in significant reduction of earthworks CAPEX"												
during the early stages of the project.												
"Using a risk based approach, the consequences of small scale dump failures at the toe of the"												
dumps have been considered and appropriate mitigation measures installed. SRK anticipates												
"that without installation of the shear keys put forward in the original design (SRK, 2010),"												
deformation and failure of the substrate immediately in front of the dump toes is likely to												
occur at Kaunisvaara where peat depths exceed 2.0m. It is therefore necessary to install												
appropriate design features at strategic positions to mitigate the risk of damage to structures												
"immediately adjacent to the WRDs, such as the Tapuli clarification pond."

Page 116												
A further key design consideration will be the positioning of the perimeter drainage ditches												
and prevention of ditch collapse due to deformation of the peat horizon at the toe of the												
dumps. SRK anticipates that peat heave will occur around significant portions of the dump												
"where peat depths exceed 2.0m. Without the peat stripping and shear key installation,"												
"measures outlined in the Phase 4 report, additional monitoring and foundation preparation"												
measures shall have to be instigated to ensure the original design requirements for safe												
operation are achieved (these are summarised below). A minimum offset of 10m should be												
applied between the toe of the dumps and the edge of the perimeter ditch.												
WRD Perimeter Berm												
"During mining operations and concurrent with the advancing lifts in the centre of the dumps,"												
"waste rock will be used to construct an end-dumped, 3m high berm around and on the inside"												
of the dump perimeters. This berm will protect the drainage ditch from spreading peat												
"deformation, which might result in a breach of the ditch construction. The perimeter berm"												
will be constructed to allow for traffic of light and heavy duty machinery and permit access												
to the peripheral areas of the WRD. The positioning of berm installations shall be decided												
by the resident geotechnical engineer.												
Dump Construction Sequence												
After deposition of the 3m waste rock horizon around particular sections of both dump												
"perimeters, the first entire lift will be built up to 7m. Rock dump construction shall progress"												
"from a central core, with waste rock being progressively dumped outwards from a number"												
of active fronts. This method relies upon the inherent strength of the existing waste rock												
pile to prevent rotational failure of material through the foundations at the toe of the dump.												
A constant supply of good quality solid rock waste is therefore necessary.												
This will commence at Tapuli after 9 months of operations when sufficient volumes of												
"waste rock are available for construction. Following on from this, one 7m lift and two"												
subsequent 10m lifts of waste rock will be deposited as per Figure 16-23. These lifts will be												
built as part of the normal WRD progression. A 10m wide catch bench will be constructed												
and left at the toe of each level. Haul road construction will be required across zones of												
"marshland previously identified (SRK, 2010), however run-of-mine waste rock will be"												
"utilized for this process, which will be included in the operational expenditure."

"At completion of the first 4 lifts, reaching a total height of approximately 34m, two"												
"additional lifts will be constructed, one 20m in height and the final 21m in height. A 20m"												
and a 25m wide catch bench will be constructed at the toe of each level as per Figure 16-23												
above.												
The final two lifts will be constructed to accept the remaining waste rock volumes and												
therefore the height may be variable. SRK recommends the final run of mine waste rock is												
dumped towards the centre of the dump to promote shedding from the centre.												
PAF Pad Construction												
The waste rock produced in Sahavaara during the planned life of mine will be 400Mt in												
"total, of which 154Mt is potentially acid forming based on geochemical characterisation"												
undertaken by SRK. To prevent contact between the PAF material and the underlying												
"substrate within the WRD area, the PAF material will not be placed directly on peat. Instead,"												
this material will be buffered from the ground surface by a minimum 3m lift of benign waste												
"rock. The material will be segregated into two cells in the middle of the dump, separated by"												
the Sahavaara ramp road and located immediately to north and to the south of the rock-fill												
"road, respectively. This 3m base of non acid forming waste rock will diminish contact with a"												
fluctuating water table at the base of the dump. The PAF-material encountered before the												
ramp road has been completed into the central parts of the dump will be temporarily stored												
inside the pit area.												
"The storage method will be the blended core option, schematically illustrated in Figure"												
"16-24. This method, which includes synchronous dumping of non-acid forming material,"												
"will prevent concentration of PAF material in the core, also maximises neutralisation of"												
"acidic fluids and attenuation of mobilised metals. Simultaneously as the core rises, the sides"												
of it will be covered with moraine to prevent air intrusion and the subsequent oxidation of												
metals.

"16.6.5	Conclusions and Recommendations"												
"•	The geotechnical site investigation and laboratory testing for both dumps was"												
adequate for feasibility level of foundation characterization; data from these was used												
to for stability analysis of the dumps under a variety of lift height and slope angle												
scenarios.												
"•	The dump configuration outlined in Figure 16-23 above is reasonable and has been"												
determined based upon stability analysis using (SlopeW) software.												
"•	The ongoing kinetic geochemical testing for the ARD potential of the waste rock may"												
lead to the requirement for an alternative encapsulation strategy at Sahavaara (Section												
16.7.4). This data should be reviewed when available and incorporated at detailed												
design stage.												
"•	The Sahavaara dump may require additional raises depending on the final volumes of"												
the waste rock. This raise is likely to be insignificant and can potentially be												
"accommodated by surplus capacity at the Tapuli WRD. Alternatively, the final dump"												
height could be raised to safely accommodate this material.												
"•	There is a likelihood of increased operational costs for the maintenance of the"												
perimeter ditches and drainage around the toe of the dumps. Removal of peat												
stripping measures and shear keys from the original feasibility design has resulted in												
"an increased likelihood of peat failure at the toe of the dumps, which could encroach"												
upon the excavated ditches. Increased OPEX may occur associated with remediation												
of the drainage ditches in these zones. Northland has accepted these cost implications												
which will be covered by the OPEX contingency budget.												
"•	SRK has put forward specific monitoring measures to ensure peat deformation and"												
"slope failures are minimised throughout the operational phase of the dumps (SRK,"												
"2010e), these should be observed at all times to ensure that operations are not"												
compromised by potential localised peat failures and the OPEX remains within the												
cost model contingency.												
"16.7	Environmental Management"												
This section highlights the key issues identified in the Environmental and Social Impact												
"Assessment (ESIA) chapter of the Feasibility Study, which was prepared by ERM. SRK’s"												
comment on the status of these issues is given along with an indication of whether any of the												
issues are considered material to the project and how the issues are being managed.												
A number of studies have been undertaken by various organizations to characterize and												
understand the environmental and social setting of the project and evaluate the impacts

"16.7.1	Swedish regulatory requirements"												
Environmental approval is granted in accordance with the Environmental Code (1998:808).												
The Code regulates areas of national interest (this includes reindeer herding and mineral												
"deposits, both of which have relevance to this project), stipulates general requirements for"												
environmental impact assessments and enables European Directives to be incorporated into												
Swedish law. The ESIA chapter summarizes the legal requirements and provides												
information on the status of the various environmental and mining permits. A summary of												
the permit status is given in Table 16-6.												
Swedish law currently requires the project proponent to undertake environmental (and												
social) assessment at two different stages of the project development. The first MKB is												
produced when applying for an exploitation concession under the terms of the Minerals Act												
(1194:45) from the Mining Inspectorate of Sweden (Bergsstaten). Although the exploitation												
"concession follows the Minerals Act, the accompanying MKB is performed according to the"												
requirements of the Environmental Code (1998:808). The emphasis of this MKB is on												
showing there is no obvious conflict with the surrounding land uses and the assessment is												
based on early project design information. Stakeholder consultation is required and the												
Lanstyrelsen (local environmental authority) will provide comment on the MKB. Approval												
of the exploitation concession is required prior to submitting an application for the												
environmental permit to mine to the Environmental Court (Miljodomstol).												
"The environmental permit application, under the terms of the Environment Code"												
"(1998:808), also requires an MKB, which is based on a more defined project description"												
than the MKB prepared for the exploitation concession application. The Environment Code												
indicates such applications would normally be evaluated by the Swedish Environmental												
"Court with input from various regulatory authorities, most notably Lanstyrelsen."												
Stakeholder consultation is required during the application process.

"In the case of the Tapuli application, the Environmental Court determined the application"												
should be processed by the Swedish-Finnish Border River Commission (Finsk-svenska												
"gransalvskommissionen or GAK) because of potential impacts on the Muonio River, which"												
forms the border between Sweden and Finland. The Environmental Court considered the												
scale of potential impacts to the Muonio River from the Project such that the GAK was the												
"appropriate regulatory authority. However, subsequently the border river agreement has"												
"changed, and in the future GAK, upon request from the Environmental Court, will assess"												
impacts to the river and produce a statement that will be considered by the Environmental												
Court when evaluating the Sahavaara application.												
"In February 2011, to expedite the permit process the Environmental Court requested the"												
"Sahavaara application be separated into two parts: 1) aspects concering the mine, WRD,"												
associated infrastructure and the transport corridor to the Kaunisvaara Mill. 2) changes to												
"Kaunisvaara mill, such as the flotation process line, to the TMF, water balance, etc."												
"Northland complied, submitting the amended permit application in mid Mar, 2011."												
Following changes in Best Practice for mine permitting in Sweden during March 2011 and												
"following discussions with the County Administration Board, Northland developed a single"												
"permit application covering all operations at Tapuli, Kaunisvaara Mill and Sahavaara. A"												
"single application will encapsulate all aspects, impacts and effects of the whole operations,"												
and is more likely to be accepted by the Swedish EPA and/or CAB. The result will be a												
single permit for Northland’s operations at or around Kaunisvaara.												
The existing permit for Tapuli Mine & Kaunisvaara Mill remains valid during this process.												
Both the environmental permit to mine and the relevant construction permits have to be												
obtained prior to construction. Construction of buildings requires a Construction Permit												
(Bygglov) from the relevant municipality under the terms of the Planning and Building Act												
"1987:10). A proponent applies for a Construction Permit from the Municipality, and for"												
"mining activities the environmental permit to mine, granted by the Environmental Court,"												
"must accompany the application. Site preparation, such as roads, clearing, etc, can start upon"												
granting of the environmental permit and do not need additional permitting.

A detailed plan covering the proposed activity and the socio-geographic area in which the												
"activity takes place needs to be developed by the Municipality to ensure the activity, in this"												
"case mining, is suitable for the proposed location. This provides the legal basis for activities"												
and developments to occur in specific areas. An MKB of limited scope is prepared by the												
municipality for the detailed plan and submitted to Lanstyrelsen. The project proponent may												
be requested to submit information in support the development of the detailed plan.												
"16.7.2	Status of land and water access rights"												
Critical to obtaining approval to mine is confirmation of right of access to water and land.												
Water rights for those areas directly impacted by drawdown of water from the pits must be												
"obtained prior to submission of the environmental permit application, whilst land access"												
rights must be obtained before construction commences.												
Northland has developed and documented a Land and Water Access Plan (LWAP) to												
document the process by which land and water rights will be obtained. This is being												
regularly updated with the latest version available for review dated September 2010 (the												
"latest update to the LWAP was May 2011, though this has not been reviewed by SRK). The"												
plan includes budget estimates for purchase and or lease of the relevant land. There are no												
permanent or temporary residences in the Tapuli area but a significant part of the Sahavaara												
village will be affected. The LWAP indicates the status of the five key areas where land												
"negotiations are required; these are summarised below. In addition, Northland is"												
considering: •												
"•	community compensation (in the form of community development) for Sahavaara as"												
others in the community will be indirectly affected by mining activities; and												
"•	compensation to the reindeer herders for disturbance to herding practices, grazing"												
areas and migration routes.												
"•	Tapuli central area (includes mine pit, waste rock dump, Kaunsivaara industrial area"												
and tailings management facility). All water and land agreements are in place.												
"•	Tapuli buffer zone (1 km zone around the central area designated to facilitate"												
community health and safety protection - land owners may have limited access for												
certain activities). Negotiations have commenced with the land owners and most of												
the land in question is owned by the same landowners as the Central area so the												
owners will be familiar with the negotiation process. Affected areas have been												
identified and preliminary budget estimates for land acquisition prepared. Agreements												
"are in place for most of the land, mostly to the west of the pit. Some agreements"												
"remain to be finalised, mostly for land to the north of the pit."												
"•	Sahavaara central zone (includes mine pit and waste rock dump). Northland has a"												
strategy in place to obtain both water and land access to these areas (refer to the												
LWAP). Landowners have been consulted and negotiations initiated. Water rights												
were obtained prior to submission of the environmental permit application. Land												
"rights are only required before construction commences, which is scheduled for 2013."

certain activities). The land portions required and the current land uses have been												
identified in the LWAP and the landowners consulted. Northland has identified three												
levels of compensation for these properties depending on whether there are:												
permanently occupied dwellings; temporarily occupied dwellings (holiday homes);												
and/or land/forest. The compensation strategy’s aim is to compensate affected parties												
in such a way that they will be able to acquire similar properties in a radius that												
extends to and includes Pajala town. Although agreements are not required until at												
"least 2013, the resettlement process is likely to take a significant amount of time so"												
"needs to be formally initiated as soon as practicable, with written records kept of each"												
meeting/discussion (including telephone communications). Northland has concluded												
"three home purchase agreements, out of a required fifteen permanent residents. There"												
is a moderate risk that the scale and significance of relocation required may lead to												
"delays in obtaining both regulatory approval to commence construction, as well as the"												
project’s ‘social licence to operate’ from the community (discussed further below).												
"• Servitudes for supporting infrastructures such as pipelines, roads and the water"												
"supply/discharge pump station. As pipelines will be buried, significant disturbance is"												
not expected and Northland has indicated that only a once off servitude payment is												
likely be required. The pump station may require land purchase of approximately 1												
ha. Landowners along the route have been consulted but as the route has not yet been												
"finalised, formal negotiations have not yet been initiated. Budget estimates for these"												
servitudes have been prepared.												
"16.7.3	Comparison with international guidelines and standards"												
Although a detailed review of the MKBs was not undertaken by SRK as the main report and												
"supporting documents were in Swedish (an English language is now available, though SRK"												
"has not reviewed this), an English translation of the Tapuli MKB was reviewed along with"												
other documents available in English. This review indicates the environmental and social												
assessment process undertaken is broadly compliant with the Equator Principles that are												
applicable to projects in high income OECD countries (Table 16-7).

Principle	Status of Kaunisvaara Project											
"EP1: Review and categorisation -
Categorise the risk of a project based on
the environmental and social screening
criteria of the International Finance
Corporation (IFC)"	"According to the IFC criteria, the project would be
Category A as it has potentially significant adverse
social or environmental impacts that are diverse,
irreversible or unprecedented. Under the European
Union EIA Directive, which underlies Swedish
legislation, the project fall under Annex I and as such
also requires the completion of detailed impact
assessment."											
"EP2: Social and environmental
assessment - For Category A projects,
complete a social and environmental
assessment process to address relevant
impacts and risks of the project. Propose
mitigation and management measures
relevant and appropriate to the nature
and scale of the project."	"Impacts have been identified in the MKBs prepared for
Tapuli and Sahavaara. Mitigation measures for
negative impacts have been proposed.
The MKB's include a brief project description, a
description of the pre-mining project setting, an
evaluation of alternatives, identification of impacts and
proposal of mitigation measures. Stakeholder
consultation was a fundamental part of the process."											
"EP 3: Applicable social and
environmental standards - the
assessment will be in compliance with
local law as the project is located in a
high income OECD country."	"For high income OECD countries this Principles states
that compliance with host country legal and regulatory
requirements is considered sufficient to indicate
compliance. The Tapuli environmental permit has been
approved so the host country requirements are
assumed to be satisfied. Sahavaara's exploitation
concession application is still pending however, based
on the documentation reviewed and discussions with
Northland personnel, SRK has no reason to believe the
permits will be not be granted subject to reasonable
conditions."											
"EP 7: Independent Review - An
independent social and/or environmental
expert not directly associated with the
borrower will review the project to assess
for Equator Principles compliance."	"As funding is being sought from an Equator Principles
financial institution, independent review is currently
underway."											
"EP 8: Covenants - The borrower will
covenant in financing documentation:
a) to comply with all relevant host country
social and environmental laws,
regulations and permits in all material
respects;
b) not yet applicable;
c) not yet applicable; and
d) to decommission the facilities, where
applicable and appropriate, in
accordance with an agreed
decommissioning plan."	"Northland has made commitments in its policy
statement to comply with or exceed host country legal
requirements and to close the mine in a responsible
manner.
A closure plan has been prepared and costs estimated
for inclusion in the financial model (Section 16.8)."

Reporting - Independent monitoring of
compliance during the life of the project"	Not yet applicable.											
"16.7.4	Key environmental and social issues"												
The ESIA Feasibility Chapter identified the key issues for the project. These are												
"summarized below with the exception of mine closure and rehabilitation, which is discussed"												
in Section 16.8. SRK’s review of available documentation has not identified any further												
issues likely to be material to the project.

Water management												
"Extensive hydrological, hydrogeological and geochemical studies have been undertaken to"												
characterize the baseline environment and predict likely impacts. It is predicted that during												
"the first eight years, water may be required from the Muonio river system, with the demand"												
"representing less than 1% of the river’s natural flow. For the majority of the mine life, a"												
"discharge is likely to be required, particularly during the annual snowmelt period. The"												
discharge is expected to represent 0.1% of the rivers flow and the effluent will be treated to												
meet agreed quality standards. With the commitments made by Northland (and imposed on												
"it in the environmental permit), these impacts are not expected to pose a significant risk to"												
the project.												
Geochemical tests indicate that some of the material taken from the Sahavaara pit has the												
potential to generate acid. This material will report to both the waste rock dump and the												
"tailings storage facility (following processing), as well as remain in the pit wall. Northland"												
proposes to manage these risks by:												
"•	developing the waste rock dump in such a way that the potential acid generating"												
waste rock is encapsulated within buffer material also taken from the pit; and												
"•	constructing the tailings storage facility so that Tapuli tailings are deposited first,"												
"followed by blended Tapuli and Sahavaara tailings, and finally an overlay of at least 2"												
"to 3 meters Tapuli tailings, which contain high levels of buffering material."												
"SRK has undertaken the geochemical characterization of the waste rock (SRK, 2010a) some"												
of which is still ongoing and designed the waste rock dump. SRK has also undertaken												
"numerical modeling to predict seepage water quality for the waste rock dumps. In addition,"												
it reviewed the geochemical characterization of the tailings test work undertaken by												
"Eriksson, (2010), which is also ongoing."												
The current status of the waste rock characterization test work and source term modeling is												
described here. The Tapuli waste rock has bulk non-acid forming characteristics and shows												
only minor potential to leach potentially problematic elements. The Sahavaara waste rock												
has bulk potentially acid forming characteristics and has some potential to leach potentially												
problematic elements. Although these predictions have been provisionally quantified												
"through numerical modeling of initial humidity cell testwork results, humidity cell testing is"												
ongoing and revisions to the modeling will be made on completion of this work. It is												
anticipated that the testwork will be complete by the end of June 2011. The following is a												
summary of ongoing work: •												
"•	humidity cell testing of samples of potentially acid forming and non-acid forming"												
waste rock material from the Sahavaara and Tapuli pits;												
"•	attenuation testwork to determine the potential of peat and till material underlying the"												
Sahavaara and Tapuli waste rock dumps to remove potential contaminates from												
solution; and												
"•	revision of source term seepage water quality predictions on completion of ongoing"												
testwork.

SRK Consulting												
Kaunisvaara 43-101												
Page 126												
The current status of the tailings characterization test work indicates:												
"•	Tapuli combined pilot tailings are not acid forming and the humidity cell test has been"												
terminated after reaching steady state conditions at 40 weeks;												
"•	humidity cell testing of the potentially acid forming Sahavaara tails and the composite"												
tailings (Tapuli and Sahavaara) is ongoing - of these only the high sulfur Sahavaara												
tails had produced acidic leachates after 23 weeks and is therefore confirmed as												
potentially acid forming;												
"•	the Sahavaara low sulfur and Sahavaara and Tapuli composite tailings samples were"												
"producing near neutral pH leachates after 23 to 25 weeks, respectively (Eriksson,"												
"2010), and these test are ongoing to confirm their acid generating potential;"												
"•	additional testwork is planned when mill production starts. This will include lab and"												
site tests focusing on the combined Tapuli + Sahavaara as well as the high sulfur												
tailings to confirm their acid generating capacity and to confirm the future deposition												
strategy for these materials. .												
"SRK considers the current predictions regarding the tailings facility sound, based on the"												
available information.												
Natural mitigation of any seepage from the waste rock dump and tailings storage facility is												
provided by the adsorption properties of the underlying peat and the low hydraulic												
conductivity of the peat and till. During operation the pit will act as a groundwater												
"discharge zone drawing any affected seepage towards it. At closure, groundwater levels are"												
expected to be close to the surface so potentially acid generating lithologies in the pit wall												
will be covered thus reducing the likelihood of oxidation and acid generation.												
Geochemical test work has a moderate level of uncertainty and as such there is a potential												
the impacts could be worse than currently predicted. This results in a risk that more												
expensive closure options will need to be considered. If a top or bottom cover with a												
"synthetic liner or long term treatment of leachate is required, these could result in potentially"												
"material costs either as upfront capital or at closure. To manage these risks, Northland has"												
committed to confirmatory geochemical studies and monitoring throughout construction and												
into operation to enable it to determine if the initial predictions are accurate. The closure												
plan (Section 16.8) may need to be revised based on the results of these investigations.												
Nature conservation and biodiversity												
The MKB’s have identified a number of impacts on nature conservation and biodiversity.												
Although much of the project land (dominated by marshland or forestry) has undergone												
"modification due to anthropogenic actions over a long period of time (notably forestry,"												
"draining and ditching, and small-scale agriculture), the scale and nature of the human"												
impacts to the area do not adversely affect the lands ability to continue to support natural												
"biodiversity, with the possible exception of the eutrophicated Kaunisvaara Lake."

The project is located within 10 km of five Natura 2000 sites (protected in terms of EU and												
"Swedish legislation), though only the Torne/Kalix/Muonio river system is likely to be"												
indirectly affected by the project (discharge of effluent into the Muonio). None of the												
qualifying species of these Natura 2000 sites were identified within project affected												
"footprints, though otter spoor was recorded along the Kaunisjoki River just south of the"												
project area.												
Identified impacts include: direct loss of habitat (some marshland hosting small populations												
of protected species such as orchids); habitat fragmentation (fences blocking movement of												
large terrestrial mammals - see impact on reindeer herding below); changes to aquatic												
ecosystems such as reduction in flow from loss of catchment and the risk of changes in												
quality due to direct and indirect discharges not meeting stipulated standards; disturbance												
"from noise, vibration and air quality; and road kills. The pre-disturbance environment has"												
"been well characterized and the impacts clearly identified, with management plans in place"												
where necessary.												
Changes to the socio-economic setting of the project area												
"The project will bring clear economic benefits to the area, including direct and indirect"												
"employment opportunities, taxes and revenue for the public sector (ideally resulting in"												
"improved services), increased availability of goods and services, and a reversal of the"												
demographic decline and trend for young people to move away in search of employment.												
These benefits will be felt mainly by the Pajala municipality and local people and												
"businesses. However, these benefits are partially offset by a number of negative impacts,"												
which will be felt predominantly by the local villages of Kaunsivaara and Sahavaara.												
Stakeholder consultation showed that attachment to the land and emotional connections to												
"the community is strong, therefore resettlement in Sahavaara village is likely to have a"												
"significant impact. As well as the use of land for forestry and hunting, residents emphasized"												
"the importance of recreational activities including berry picking, fishing, sledding and small"												
scale hunting. The close sense of community currently held by the residents of Sahavaara												
will change as a result of:												
"•	some community members being obliged to move away from the area to find suitable"												
alternative accommodation;												
"•	new residents coming into the community as a result of increase job opportunities;"												
and												
"•	the industrial nature of mining in comparison to the current agricultural and forestry"												
lifestyle.												
Northland has recognised that these negative impacts need to be managed sensitively to												
ensure it receives its ‘social licence to operate’ and it is proposing a number of measures to												
"minimize the negative impacts and optimize the positive impacts, notably including: •"												
"•	communication, grievance and land acquisition plans are already in place and being"												
utilized;

Sameby reindeer herders												
The Sami are internationally recognised as Indigenous People and are spread across northern												
Europe and into Russia. The Reindeer Herding Act of 1971 organised the Sami into groups												
"called Samebys. The project lies within the Muonio Concession Sameby, which has eight"												
active reindeer herders with reindeer owned by both Sami and non-Sami (the latter being												
"herded by the Sami in the Sameby. The concession is permitted to have 3,900 reindeer (at"												
the start of 2010 there were 2840 reindeer in the concession) and is managed by a board that												
meets annually. The current concession expires at the end of 2010 and negotiations for a												
new concession are underway. It is understood that no sites of significant cultural												
importance to the Sami will be directly affected by the project.												
"The project will reduce land available to the Sameby by approximately 1%, with the"												
"majority of land take affecting grazing areas, though Tapuli pit and part of the industrial"												
zone lie on the eastern edge of the an important comfort zone used for spring grazing and												
"calving area. In addition, the Sami have expressed concern over the location of the"												
"Sahavaara waste rock dump, which lies adjacent to an area of good grazing."												
"Negative impacts on reindeer associated with noise, vibration and dust are poorly"												
understood. Northland is actively engaging with the Sameby and a number of mitigation												
and/or compensation measures are being considered. To date the Muonio Sameby has												
"expressed support for the project, albeit with some reservations as noted above. Although,"												
"no objections have yet been raised by the Sameby, other mining projects in Sweden have"												
been subject to delays caused by objections from the Sami population. Therefore moderate												
project risks exist relating to possible delays arising from appeals to the Sahavaara permit												
application or poor public relations.												
Transport options												
The Tapuli permit application reflects the original transport option using rail to transport the												
concentrate to a port in Finland. The current preferred option is now a combined road/rail												
transport route to a port in Norway. The implications of this recent change in the project												
description will need to be discussed with the relevant regulatory authorities. No additional												
"permits are reportedly required. However, Northland is engaged with Trafikverket to get"												
dispensation to use a truck size larger than that currently allowed on the road. The reason for												
"this is to lower transport costs per unit of concentrate, and reduce the environmental and"												
social impacts by reducing the number of trucks required to transport the magnetite												
concentrate.

It is understood that the road between Kaunsivaara and Svappavaara is an existing high												
capacity road and approximately 240 truck trips per day will be required (approximately 10												
trucks per hour). This results in an increase of between 10% and 60% of existing traffic												
movements. The current road passes through a number of small villages where impacts												
"associated with noise, vibrations, dust and the physical occupation of road constituting"												
obstacles for other traffic. It is understood that the predicted truck frequency is based on the												
use of ‘road trains’ (truck with two trailers attached). If such trucks are not approved by the												
Swedish road authorities then the frequency of truck movements would increase due the use												
of smaller trucks.												
This recent change in project description gives rise to the following project risks relating to												
environmental and social issues:												
"•	delay in project implementation due to the need for additional studies and truck"												
dispensation process; and												
"•	schedule delays and additional costs associated stakeholder objections to any"												
bypasses or if unacceptably significant impacts are identified for a specific receptor (it												
"is understood that Trafikverket remain solely responsible for any road upgrades, by-"												
"passes, etc. so direct costs and delays are unlikely)."												
Northland is undertaking the additional studies needed to characterize the likely impacts and												
associated mitigation measures required to implement this transport option. The evaluation												
will reportedly focus on road transport as the impacts associated with the use of trucks is												
expected to be significantly higher than those associated with rail and the use of the port.												
"16.7.5	Conclusion"												
"•	Northland has undertaken a comprehensive environmental and social impact"												
assessment process for both mines and the Kaunisvaara processing site and tailings												
storage facility. The recent change in the preferred ore transport option requires												
additional environmental and social impact assessments to be undertaken.												
"•	No environmental and social fatal flaws have been identified but a number of issues"												
exist that will need to be evaluated proactively to ensure material costs are not												
"realized, in particular: acid rock drainage potential associated with some of the"												
Sahavaara mine waste rock and tailings; disposal; impacts on ecologically protected												
areas; resettlement and land acquisition; changes to the transport option; and												
relationships with the local Sami who are the Sameby concession holders.												
"•	Northland has appointed a suitably qualified team to manage identified impacts and is"												
"in the process of developing environmental, social and health and safety management"												
systems to facilitate the implementation of identified management measures.												
"•	The necessary permits have either been obtained or there is a strategy in place to"												
obtain these. There is a risk of the Sahavaara environmental permit application												
submission being delayed due to requests by the Environmental Court for												
reformatting the application in line with changes in permitting practice subsequent to												
the submittal of the application.

"16.8	Mine Closure"												
Implementation of the EU Directive relating to wastes from extractive industries (Directive												
2006/21/EC) into Swedish law has resulted in the requirement for mine operators to submit												
a preliminary plan for closure with the environmental permit application (Section 16.7.1).												
This closure plan and the associated costs will be approved by the Environmental Court.												
The operator must then make provision for a financial guarantee to cover the reclamation												
costs should it not be able to fulfil its duties. The guarantee is required for the actual area of												
"land affected and is linked to the mine schedule. During operation, the actual disturbance"												
will be reported to the authorities and the increase in the closure provision will be												
"determined accordingly. If progressive rehabilitation is undertaken, the cost for this can be"												
withdrawn from the bond upon acceptance by the regulatory authority appointed by the												
Environmental Court. The closure costs and associated bond will be reviewed when the												
closure plan is reviewed i.e. at least once every three years.												
A closure plan has been prepared by Hifab and updated by Golder Associates for Tapuli and												
"Sahavaara mining operations, the Kaunisvaara industrial area and the tailings management"												
facility. The plan indicates: the general closure objectives and guidelines relevant to the												
project; the natural setting and pre-mining conditions; the alternative closure options for												
each type of facility; and the preferred closure strategy for each facility. Risk and												
"uncertainties have also been identified, along with a schedule for closure implementation."												
SRK considers that the closure plan is appropriate for this stage in the project development.												
"As committed to by Northland, this will need to be reviewed as the project is implemented"												
and additional monitoring information becomes available.												
Closure costs were derived based on the preferred closure plan and known costs from												
previous mine reclamation calculations. Northland has committed to reviewing these												
"regularly (at least every three years). SRK considers that the closure costs, summarised"												
"below, are adequate subject to ongoing review, in particular with respect to the risk items"												
discussed in Section 16.7.4.

"16.9	Economic Analysis"												
"16.9.1	Introduction"												
SRK has constructed a Technical Economic Model (TEM) to derive a Net Present Value												
(NPV) for the Kaunisvaara project. The TEM is based on the technical assumptions												
"developed as part of the Feasibility Study, as commented on in the previous sections of this"												
report.												
"16.9.2	Valuation Process"												
General Assumptions												
"The model is based on production from two open pit mines (Tapuli and Shavaara), feeding"												
two process streams with a combined maximum annual throughput of 12Mtpa and housed												
"within a single processing plant. The plant produces a magnetite concentrate of 69% Fe,"												
"which is transported by a road and rail from the Kaunisvaara site to the port of Narvik,"												
Norway.												
"SRK has constructed a pre-tax and pre-finance TEM. The valuation currency is USD, with"												
any SEK or EUR derived costs being converted as follows:												
"•	SEK:USD exchange rate of 8.125:1 for operating costs;"												
"•	SEK:USD exchange rate of 6.57:1 for capital costs; and"												
"•	EUR:USD exchange rate of 0.7813:1."												
The model assumes a base case discount rate of 8% and has been produced in Real Terms.												
Commodity Price Assumptions												
Table 16-9 below presents the iron ore price forecast for the life of mine. Commodity price												
forecast data was provided to SRK by Northland. Northland developed this forecast												
"internally, based on an independent third party report by Raw Materials Group (RMG) and"												
public domain dry bulk shipping cost forecast data.

Concentrate Transport Operating Costs												
The TEM currently assumes that the ore will be transported to the port of Narvik in Norway												
and that the capital costs associated with the development of the transport corridor involving												
road transport to Sappavaara and rail to the shiploading port at Narvik will be borne by a												
Joint Venture company involving Northland and two interested parties who are currenly												
negotiating their participation in the Joint Venture with Northland. It is anticipated that												
funding will come from JV equity of 30% and 70% from financing still to be arranged. The												
capital and operating costs have been estimated in detail. This detail has been included in the												
"current TEM where the cost per tonne for transport and shiploading, inclusive of capital, has"												
been calculated. The rate per tonne for transportation of concentrates from Kaunisvaara to												
"the ship at the port in Narvik amounts to US$26.4, but this does not include any allowances"												
for return on JV equity or JV profit as those are still subject to negotiation.												
Other Operating Costs												
"Table 16-5 presents the total mineral royalty, G&A and “Other” operating costs with respect"												
to the total ore tonnes mined. “Other” includes total closure costs of USD 27 million.

Capital Costs												
The capital costs estimated as part of the Feasibility Study have been incorporated in to the												
TEM. These costs total USD 899 million and include a 10% contingency. Overall SRK												
considers these costs to be reasonable for the Project in the context of the Feasibility Study												
undertaken.

"16.9.3	Cash Flow Projections"												
A valuation of the Kaunisvaara Project has been derived based on the application of												
"Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) techniques to the pre-tax, pre-finance cash flow developed for"												
Kaunisvaara based on the inputs and assumptions presented in this and previous sections of												
this report. All figures are presented in real terms.												
"In summary, at an 8% discount rate the project has an NPV of USD 1 465 million. SRK"												
notes that this valuation is significantly higher than the previous Project valuation of USD												
"770 million, as derived by SRK and presented in the technical report entitled “Technical"												
"Review of the Kaunisvaara iron project, Sweden”, dated 3 October, 2010. The principal"												
reason for this difference can be attributed to substantially higher price assumptions for the

"SRK is also aware that the Pellivouma iron project, being of similar geological"												
"characteristics to the Tapuli and Sahavaara iron projects, and containing both Measured and"												
Indicated Resources could be incorporated into the Kaunisvaara project at a later date.

"18	INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS"												
The primary aim of this report was to comment on the status of the Kaunisvaara Feasibility												
Study being carried out by Northland Resources AB. This involved a technical review by												
SRK of all sections of the Feasibility Study that were not conducted by SRK in addition to												
the compilation of the results of latest Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve estimates												
undertaken by SRK.												
"In total, SRK has derived a combined Measured plus Indicated Mineral Resource for Sodra"												
"Sahavaara and Stora Sahavaara of 86.8 Mt grading 39.82%Fe Total, 1.93%S, 18.26% SiO2"												
"and 14.63% MgO. Of this, 30.2 Mt grading 42.96%Fe Total and 2.66%S has been reported"												
as Measured and 56.6 Mt grading 38.14%Fe Total and 1.55%S as Indicated. In addition												
some 34.7 Mt grading 37.28%Fe Total and 1.44; %S has been reported as an Inferred												
Mineral Resource. Some 13.8 Mt of the Measured plus Indicated Mineral Resource												
comprises “high grade” material and has a mean grade of 53.38%Fe Total and 3.03%S.												
In addition SRK has derived a Measured plus Indicated Mineral Resource for Tapuli of												
"107.4Mt grading 26.01%Fe Total, 0.23 S%, 26.99% SiO2 and 17.47% MgO. Of this,"												
52.8 Mt grading 27.02 %Fe Total and 0.23 %S has been reported as Measured and 54.6 Mt												
"grading 25.04 %Fe Total and 0.24 %S as Indicated. An additional, 24.7 Mt grading 24.58"												
%Fe Total and 0.23 %S has been reported as an Inferred Mineral Resource.												
SRK has reported a Proved Mineral Reserve of 82Mt grading 32.98 %Fe Total and a												
probable Mineral Reserve of 83Mt grading 32.51 %Fe Total.												
"SRK is confident that sufficient geological work has been undertaken, and sufficient"												
"geological understanding gained, to enable the construction of an orebody model suitable for"												
the derivation of Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve estimates. SRK considers that both												
the modelling and the grade interpolation have been carried out in an unbiased manner and												
that the resulting grade and tonnage estimates should be reliable within the context of the												
"classification applied. In addition, SRK is not aware of any metallurgical, infrastructural,"												
"environmental, legal, title, taxation, socio-economic or marketing issues that would impact"												
on the Mineral Resource or Reserve statements as presented.												
The forecast capital and operating costs incorporated into the TEM have been reviewed by												
SRK and accepted as being reasonable given the information currently available and in the												
"context of the Feasibility Study. The forecast operating costs total USD 3,491 million,"												
including a 5% contingency over the life of mine while the forecast capital costs total USD												
899 million and include a 10% contingency.												
A valuation of the Kaunisvaara Project has been derived based on the application of												
"Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) techniques to the pre-tax, pre-finance cash flow developed for"												
Kaunisvaara.

"In summary, at an 8% discount rate the project has an NPV of USD 1 465 million. SRK"												
notes that this valuation is significantly higher than the previous Project valuation of USD												
"770 million, as derived by SRK and presented in the technical report entitled “Technical"												
"Review of the Kaunisvaara iron project, Sweden”, dated 3 October, 2010. The principal"												
reason for this difference can be attributed to substantially higher price assumptions for the												
Kaunisvaara magnetite product.

"19	RECOMMENDATIONS"												
It is the recommendation of SRK that the waste rock dump storage facility aspects of the												
study are updated to match the current mining schedule which may result in certain cost												
"savings, although these are not considered to be material to the project as a whole."
