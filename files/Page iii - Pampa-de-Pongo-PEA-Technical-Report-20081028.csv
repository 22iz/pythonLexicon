Executive Summary																																		
The Pampa de Pongo iron ore (magnetite) project consists of a block of 8 adjoining mining																																		
concessions (Concesion Minera)and 10 mining claims (Petitorio Minero) encompassing an area																																		
"19 km long and up to 10 km wide (15,300 hectares). The project is located on the southern coastal"																																		
"plain of Peru, 50 km south of the city of Nazca and 550 km southeast of Lima, in the province of"																																		
"Caraveli, in the governing jurisdiction of Arequipa. The geographic center of the property is located"																																		
"at 74° 50"" W longitude, 15° 23"" S latitude. The property is at approximately 400 m in elevation and"																																		
"is 20 km from the Pacific Ocean, 10 km from the Pan-American Highway and 38 km for the"																																		
deep-sea port of San Juan. The property is located in a desert environment with minimal rainfall and																																		
very sparse vegetation.																																		
Cardero Resource Corp. completed an option to purchase a 100% undivided interest in the property																																		
"from Rio Tinto Mining and Exploration, Sucursal Peru (Rio Tinto). The Concesiones Mineras"																																		
"(8,000 ha) are presently in the process of being transferred from Rio Tinto to Cardero Peru, however,"																																		
as of writing they are still held by Rio Tinto. Rio Tinto anticipates that the concession transfers will																																		
"be completed imminently. The 10 Petitorios Mineros (7,300 ha) are held 100% by"																																		
Cardero Peru S.A.C.																																		
The Pampa de Pongo deposit was discovered by Rio Tinto in 1994 as part of a regional Iron Oxide																																		
Copper Gold (“IOGC”) exploration program. Rio followed up on the discovery with drilling in 1995																																		
and 1996. The deposit does not outcrop and is buried beneath aeolian sand.																																		
"There are no historical mine workings, waste management facilities, tailings ponds or important"																																		
natural features within the area of the Pampa de Pongo claims block.																																		
Geology																																		
"The Pampa de Pongo deposit is located in the Marcona (Fe-Cu) District, named after the Marcona"																																		
"Iron Mine, which has operated continuously since 1953. The oldest rocks exposed are Precambrian"																																		
"in age and part of the Coastal Basal Complex, consisting of gneisses, potassium-rich granites and"																																		
"migmatites. This basement metamorphic complex is overlain by carbonates, pelitic sediments and a"																																		
"variety of intermediate to mafic igneous units of the Lower Paleozoic Marcona Formation, Middle to"																																		
Upper Jurassic Rio Grande Formation and Bella Union Volcanics. Small remnants of the Upper																																		
Jurassic Jahuay Formation (mixed volcanics and sediments) and Lower Cretaceous Jauca Formation																																		
(sediments) cap the Jurassic succession.																																		
Major intrusives include the San Nicolas Batholith and the more extensive Lower Cretaceous Coastal																																		
Batholith.																																		
The majority of the mineralization at the Marcona mine is hosted by carbonates of the Marcona																																		
Formation. The Pampa de Pongo deposit is hosted by the younger Jurassic Juhuay Formation.

Mineralization																																		
At Pampa de Pongo the mineralized bodies are semi-concordant and appear to have been controlled																																		
"by a number of factors, primarily structure, but also host rock lithologies, primary porosity and"																																		
secondary porosity related to fracturing or brecciation. Mineralization comprises semi-massive to																																		
massive magnetite replacement zones.																																		
There are four main zones of mineralization and potential mineralization:																																		
"1.	North Zone - An untested exploration target indicated by a large magnetic anomaly."																																		
"2.	Central Zone - The Central zone is the main focus of this PEA. It is a two-layer mineralized"																																		
"body. The lower portion consists of a flat-lying, massive replacement lens up to 370 metres"																																		
"thick, measuring approximately 1,060 metres east-west by 1,000 metres north-south at the widest"																																		
"point. The resource remains open in all directions. Mineralization is consistent, averaging"																																		
approximately 62% magnetite with multiple intersections greater than 80% magnetite. In the																																		
"overlying upper portion (not included in the current resource), massive iron mineralization is cut"																																		
"with a minor component of hypabyssal porphyry sills. The lower, high-grade massive"																																		
"replacement at Pampa de Pongo, from which the Inferred Resource has been estimated, based on"																																		
"current data, is almost completely devoid of unmineralized intrusive rocks."																																		
"3.	East Zone - The East Zone is indicated by a 3D magnetic anomaly, the dimensions of which,"																																		
suggest potential for 350-500 million tonnes of magnetite. A single drillhole on the southern																																		
edge of the anomaly intersected massive magnetite mineralization. Mineralization consists of																																		
3 high-grade mineralized lenses grading 41% to 44% iron over tens of metres approximately																																		
270 metres from surface. The total thickness of magnetite mineralization intersected is																																		
292 metres.																																		
"4.	South Zone - This is a near-surface resource comprised of two separate zones of predominantly"																																		
"massive magnetite mineralization with a thickness of up to 120 metres, a combined length of"																																		
"1,100 metres north-south and a width of 400 metres east-west at the widest point. This resource"																																		
has not been included in the mine schedule presented in this report and represents future upside																																		
potential.																																		
"Since the initial deposit discoveries, detailed ground magnetic surveys and 3D magnetic inversion"																																		
models have formed a critical component of exploration at Pampa de Pongo with a direct correlation																																		
between the highest magnetic susceptibility (as defined by the 3D inversion models) and significant																																		
magnetic mineralization intersected in drillholes.

Metallurgy and Mineral Processing																																		
Representative metallurgical samples were selected by SRK from four diamond drillhole cores from																																		
"the Central Zone and beneficiation, magnetic concentration and pilot-scale pelletizing tests were"																																		
conducted. The preliminary metallurgical testwork demonstrated that:																																		
"•	Wet magnetic separation would yield 93.4% Fe recovery;"																																		
"•	Metallurgical quality exceeds industry standards for high quality blast furnace feed;"																																		
"•	Commercially produced pellets made from Pampa de Pongo ore would be a suitable feedstock"																																		
for the MIDREX ® Direct Reduction Process; and																																		
"•	Deleterious materials in the pellets would be at or below acceptable levels."																																		
The mineral processing design for this study includes crushing - grinding - flotation - wet magnetic																																		
separation and pelletization. Economic values of copper and gold are anticipated to be extracted in																																		
the flotation stage with 50% recovery assumed for both metals.																																		
Mineral Resource Estimate																																		
The mineral resources were estimated by Ebi Ghayem (P.Geo.) and reviewed by Marek Nowak																																		
(P.Eng.) and George Wahl (P.Geo.) who are all Qualified Persons. The effective date of the Mineral																																		
"Resource Statement is September 30th, 2008. SRK is not aware of any environmental, permitting,"																																		
"legal, title, taxation, socio-political, marketing or other relevant issues that may affect the mineral"																																		
resource estimate.																																		
The classified inferred mineral resource estimates at 15% Fe cut-off grade are tabulated in Table 1.

The resources represent all estimated blocks within the modeled zones. The economic cut-off used to																																		
generate mineral resources was assumed and based on experience with similar projects. The final																																		
cut-off required to produce a saleable product will need to be confirmed by future metallurgical																																		
testwork. This economic cut-off was applied to both the Central and South Zones. Although the																																		
"South Zones contribute a relatively small tonnage, SRK is of the opinion that there are reasonable"																																		
prospects for additional tonnage in this area which may then make these resources amenable to																																		
underground mining methods. Table 2 shows the mineral inventory at various cut-off grades.																																		
Two exploration targets also exist on the property. The East Zone exploration target may potentially																																		
contain a conceptual tonnage of 350 to 500 Mt of magnetite mineralization. A single hole was drilled

Mining																																		
The Central Zone massive magnetite mineralization is located between approximately 350 m and																																		
"800 m below surface and, as such, it was deemed potentially mineable by open pit or underground"																																		
"methods. An analysis of open pit and underground mining scenarios lead to the conclusion, based on"																																		
"the current data and assumptions, that an underground block cave mine would provide the most"																																		
"favourable economic results. The underground mine was designed on two sections, Block 1 and"																																		
Block 2. The variability in the geometry of the bottom of the resource required the use of the blocks																																		
"being mined from different levels. Block 1 extracts the highest grade, thickest and deepest material"																																		
"first. Block 2 is planned to extract the remaining resource from a higher undercut elevation, adjacent"																																		
to Block 1.																																		
"Based on the geometry, mining method and bulk density of the mineralization in the Central Zone,"																																		
"the production capacity of the mine was estimated to be 75,000 tpd or 27.4 MTPY. The mine"																																		
"production life is 24 years and includes a 5-year, straight-line production ramp-up. Table 3 shows the"																																		
life of mine mill feed total by mining block.

Preliminary Economic Assessment Results																																		
A preliminary discounted cash flow analysis was conducted for the project using a range of iron																																		
"pellet prices. The economic analysis used inferred mineral resources exclusively and, therefore, only"																																		
"provides a preliminary overview of the project economics based on broad, factored assumptions."																																		
Inferred mineral resources are considered too speculative geologically to have the economic																																		
"considerations applied to them to be categorized as mineral reserves, and there is no certainty that the"																																		
inferred resources will be upgraded to a higher resource category. There is also no certainty that the																																		
results of this preliminary economic assessment will be realized.																																		
The main economic parameters used in the cash flow analysis are shown in Table 6. It was assumed																																		
that the project will be equity financed.

Four cases were used in the cash flow analysis to demonstrate the variation of project economics																																		
with iron pellet price. All other variables were kept constant for all cases including the life of mine																																		
mill feed tonnes and grade. The four cases all used the assumption that pellets would be the final																																		
product. Case 1 assumed blast furnace pellets would be produced. The other cases assumed direct																																		
"reduction pellets would be produced. Pellet prices were obtained from an independent market study,"																																		
the 3-year average and reference public-domain reports and are shown in Table 7. Direct reduction																																		
pellets were assumed to have a 10% premium over blast furnace pellets.

A simplified sensitivity analysis was conducted and showed the project is most sensitive to metal																																		
price which yields a 45% variation in after-tax NPV10% for a 20% change in metal price. Mill feed																																		
grade is almost identical to the metal price sensitivity. The project is less sensitive to operating costs																																		
than capital costs. See Figure 1 below.

Conclusions																																		
"The results of this preliminary economic assessment indicate that, based on the preliminary data"																																		
"available and assumptions used, the Pampa de Pongo Project is an economically robust project that"																																		
warrants further exploration and study. The project is situated in a very favourable location within a																																		
"short distance of infrastructure, including a deep-sea port facility, located 38 km west of the deposit."																																		
"Drilling and magnetic surveys infer the presence of a large, massive magnetite mineralized Central"																																		
Zone that is conducive to underground bulk mining. The South Zone resource and other exploration																																		
"targets, particularly the East Zone, may enhance the total material available for exploitation. The"																																		
metallurgy test work done on the Central Zone mineralization confirmed the production of																																		
pilot-scale direct reduction pellets with low levels of deleterious elements.																																		
Recommendations																																		
SRK recommends two stages of work to take Pampa de Pongo to the next level of development.																																		
These recommendations are described below. The Preliminary Economic Assessment will be																																		
"contingent upon the success of the East Zone exploration drilling, while the Pre-feasibility Study will"																																		
be contingent on the success of the definition drill programs of the East Zone and/or the Central																																		
Zone.																																		
"1.	East Zone Exploration & Preliminary Economic Assessment"																																		
Exploration of the East Zone should be accelerated and prioritized to allow concurrent development																																		
"with Central Zone, assuming positive results. Critical work items include:"																																		
"•	Exploration Drilling - six holes to prove economic potential and determine Inferred"																																		
"Resources (4,500 metres)."																																		
"•	Preliminary Economic Assessment - Scoping level assessment including conceptual mine"																																		
"design, resource estimate, metallurgy and economic value. The critical aspect would be to"																																		
"determine if the potential resource could be developed concurrently with Central Zone,"																																		
increasing the annual output of the operation.																																		
"2.	Central and East Zone Pre-feasibility Study"																																		
The major components of the study should be as follows:																																		
"•	Central Zone Definition Drilling - approximately 17 drillholes, totalling 14,500m, resulting"																																		
in a 200-metre drill spacing. This should be sufficient to upgrade existing resources from																																		
Inferred Resources to at least an Indicated Resource category. All permits are in pace to																																		
complete this work.																																		
"•	East Zone Definition Drilling - Rapid definition drilling to dovetail preliminary feasibility-"																																		
level work with that being undertaken for Central Zone. This drilling would comprise																																		
"approximately six additional drillholes for 4,500 metres."																																		
"•	Geotechnical Studies - concurrent with definition drilling, detailed geotechnical analysis"																																		
including further structural definition and hydrogeology.

Page x																																		
"•	Environmental baseline - environmental monitoring, including groundwater assessment and"																																		
preparation of Environmental Impact Assessment.																																		
"•	Metallurgy - Multiple bench-scale metallurgical tests to quantify metallurgical variation"																																		
within the Central Zone. Further development of the furnace firing cycle to optimize and																																		
enhance blast furnace pellet quality. Additional grinding to reduce silica even further and																																		
conversely increase total iron grade in the pellets.																																		
"•	Central Zone Condemnation Drilling - If not already defined through definition drilling, the"																																		
outer edges of the Central Zone must be defined through up to 5 condemnation drillholes for																																		
"a total of 4,250 metres."																																		
Costs are based on a contractor quote of $120/m drilled and an estimated geotechnical logging and																																		
assaying cost of $30/m drilled.

"1	Introduction"																																		
This Preliminary Economic Assessment Technical Report was prepared by SRK for																																		
Cardero Resource Corp. The purpose of the report is to present SRK’s mineral resource estimate for																																		
the property and present preliminary economic findings for the Pampa de Pongo project based on																																		
preliminary mining and metallurgical investigations. The report also provides guidance for potential																																		
advancement of the project in the form of several recommendations.																																		
A site visit to the Pampa de Pongo property and to Cardero offices in Lima was conducted by																																		
"Qualified Persons (“QP”) Gordon Doerksen, P.Eng. and George Wahl, P.Geo, both of SRK, on"																																		
"March 17 to 20, 2008."																																		
"The project diamond drill core for the project is stored in Lima and all drill core from holes PP10,"																																		
"PPD-002, PPD-003, PP20A and PP21 was inspected by Doerksen and Wahl on March 17, 2008."																																		
"Core from drillholes RTDDH-1, RTDDH-2, RTDDH-3, PPD-19 and RTDDH-9 was inspected by"																																		
"Wahl on March 20, 2008."																																		
"During the inspection of the Pampa de Pongo property on March 18, 2008, several drillhole markers"																																		
(pipes encased in concrete bases) were inspected and coordinates verified by Wahl using a hand-held																																		
GPS unit.																																		
QPs Marek Nowak and Leonard Holland did not perform a site visit as the project is in the early																																		
exploration stage and nothing applicable to Mr. Nowak’s or Mr. Holland’s work could be gained																																		
from visiting the project.																																		
Drillhole and assay information from both the Rio Tinto and Cardero drill programs was provided by																																		
Cardero Resource Corp. 3D magnetic inversion data was provided by Quantec Geophyiscs																																		
Worldwide of Argentina. Metallurgical data was produced by																																		
The metallurgical testing was undertaken by the Natural Resources Research Institute (NRRI) in																																		
"Minnesota, United States."																																		
Details of additional sources of information are included where appropriate in the body of the report.																																		
"All units in this report are based on the International System of Units (“SI”), except for some units"																																		
which are deemed industry standards such as troy ounces (“oz”) for precious metals and pounds																																		
(“lb”) for base metals. All currency values are United States dollars (“$” or “US$” or “USD”) unless																																		
otherwise noted.																																		
"This report uses many abbreviations and acronyms common in the mining industry, most of which"																																		
are defined in the body of the text. Further explanations can be found in Section 22.

The economic analysis conducted in this report uses Inferred Mineral Resources exclusively and																																		
"only provides a preliminary overview of the project economics based on broad, factored"																																		
assumptions. Inferred mineral resources are considered too speculative geologically to have the																																		
"economic considerations applied to them to be categorized as mineral reserves, and there is no"																																		
certainty that the inferred resources will be upgraded to a higher resource category. There is also no																																		
certainty that the results of this preliminary economic assessment will be realized.

"2	Reliance on Other Experts"																																		
This report relies on marketing studies and pricing opinions for iron ore and iron pellets provided by																																		
"Global Strategic Solutions Inc., who provided a detailed analysis of historical pricing and opinions of"																																		
"long-term pricing from multiple sources. The report was authored by Sara A. Hornby, C.Eng., Ph.D.,"																																		
"President of Global Strategic Solutions, Inc. Ms Hornby’s experience includes 5 years in the"																																		
"UK steel industry, 18.5 years in the industrial gas arena in the metals, prime materials, mining, glass,"																																		
"cryogenics, welding and heat treatment markets, 2 years as Director of Operations and Technology"																																		
"for a start up company improving EAF steelmaking energy use, 4 years with Midrex Technology Inc."																																		
as their DRI/HBI steelmaking and marketing specialist before starting her own consulting company.																																		
There is no guarantee that the market studies will prove to be reliable. The selection of accurate																																		
metal prices is made extremely difficult in times of high commodity price volatility as is current the																																		
case in the world markets. SRK has used a range of iron prices to demonstrate the implications of																																		
iron prices variations.

"3	Property Description and Location"																																		
Pampa de Pongo is located on the southern coastal plain of Peru approximately 50 km south of the																																		
"city of Nazca and 550 km southeast of the Capital, Lima (Figure. 3.1). The geographic center of the"																																		
"property is located at 74° 50"" W longitude, 15° 23"" S latitude. In detail, the property is located in the"																																		
province of Caraveli in the governing jurisdiction of Arequipa.																																		
"According to Peruvian regulations, the right to explore for and exploit minerals is granted by way of"																																		
"mining concessions. In order to obtain a mining concession, a mining claim (a Petitorio Minero)"																																		
must be presented before the INGEMMET (the Peruvian Mining Authority). A Petitorio Minero is																																		
"only an application for a mining concession, therefore it does not grant any exploration or"																																		
exploitation rights but concedes to its holder a preference over the area with respect to any other																																		
"subsequent overlapping Petitorios Mineros. On acceptance of the application, the Petitorio Minero is"																																		
converted to a mining concession (a Concesion Minera). The regulations governing the process of																																		
application for Petitorio Minero result in overlapping tenure until such times as the Concesion																																		
"Minera is granted. In Figure 3.1, several of Cardero’s Petitorios Mineros are overlapping with"																																		
previously existing tenure. Only those portions of the application which are on open ground will be																																		
considered for issue as Concesion Minera to Cardero.																																		
The Pampa de Pongo property consists of 8 adjoining mining concessions and 10 mining claims.																																		
"Together, they form an area 19 km long and up to 10 km wide (15,300 hectares). The mineral"																																		
resources and mineralized zones are located within the 8 mining claims. There are no historical mine																																		
"workings, waste management facilities, tailings ponds or important natural features within the area of"																																		
the Pampa de Pongo claims block. The particulars of the claims are listed in Table 3.1 and a list of																																		
the claim corner coordinates is listed in Table 3.3. The claim corners have not been physically																																		
surveyed and marked.																																		
"A Concesion Minera gives the holder the right to explore for, and to exploit, such mineral resources"																																		
"which may be found within a body of ground of unlimited depth, the boundaries of which are"																																		
"defined by vertical planes corresponding to the sides of a cube, rectangle or closed polygon whose"																																		
vertices are defined by UTM (Universal Transverse Mercator) coordinates. An Acumulacion																																		
"Derecho Minero Titulada is granted when two or more, contiguous or overlapping, mining"																																		
"concessions, both or all of which belong to the same title holder, are grouped together in the National"																																		
"Mining Register as a single mining concession, also under the same title holder, adopting the"																																		
registration date of the oldest of the accumulated mining concessions.																																		
There are no known environmental liabilities associated with the property. The property has almost																																		
"no surface disturbance other than historical drillhole stand pipes mounted in small concrete blocks,"

The Peruvian Ministry of Mines is responsible for issuing all permits relating to mining and																																		
exploration properties. There are currently discussions in Peru to establish an Environmental																																		
Ministry. It is not known how this potential change in government structure will affect the minerals																																		
industry. There are currently three levels of permit required at various stages of exploration.																																		
"Activity Type A: Does not require a permit. Work includes geophysics, surface sample collection,"																																		
and everything that doesn’t have an environmental impact.																																		
Activities Type B: Allows construction of up to 20 drilling pads as long as less than 5% of the land																																		
is disturbed. This permit has been granted to Cardero Peru S.A.C. Permit duration is typically for the																																		
drilling season.																																		
"Activity Type C: Requires an Environmental Impact Assessment, which the government will review"																																		
over 4 months. Cardero has initiated the necessary environmental work required to make this																																		
application.																																		
"Following a feasibility study, an exploitation permit is required to commence mining. This requires a"																																		
"second environmental report with all project details, after which applications are submitted for a"																																		
"milling concession, which will be reviewed by the government for 6-12 months."																																		
Surface rights must be acquired from the government (at minimal cost) or from the appropriate																																		
community (on a lease or purchase basis).

Infrastructure and Physiography																																		
"The Project area lies within the desert coastal tract of southern Peru, approximately 550 kilometres"																																		
"south of Lima (Figure 4.1), a northward continuation of the Atacama Desert of northern Chile. It is"																																		
"extremely arid, receives little annual rainfall (<1 cm/year) and is virtually devoid of vegetation,"																																		
except in irrigated river valleys.																																		
"During the summer months, the climate is hot and dry, but there is often a moderating effect from the"																																		
"coast with an inflow of cool moist area in the morning and late in the day. During the winter months,"																																		
"the coastal areas are cool, and covered by sea mists which provide humidity of around 100%. Strong"																																		
"onshore (southeast, verging-to-south, verging-to-southwest) winds are generated at this time by solar"																																		
heating of the hinterland and pull cooler air inland from the coastal belt. These winds carry the mist																																		
"and a considerable burden of aeolian sand with them, the latter being deposited against rising ground"																																		
as the strength of the winds diminishes.																																		
The topography in the project area is essentially flat-lying. The areas overlying existing resources																																		
vary between 320 metres above sea level in the south (South Zone) to 420 metres above sea level to																																		
the north (Central Zone). Relief is more pronounced in the northeast portion of the claim block.																																		
"However, there are no mineral resources or prospects thereof in this area at this time."																																		
"The closest major community is the town of Nazca (population 22,132 as at July 2005), which is"																																		
located approximately 50 km north of the property. Nazca is located on the Pan American Highway																																		
about a 5-hour drive south of Lima and has most amenities and services available. The small rural																																		
"community of Bella Union is located 18 km by road to the southeast. The coastal village of Lomas,"																																		
"from which all project-related field work has been conducted, and which hosts the core logging and"																																		
"storage facilities for the project, lies 19 km by road from the Pampa de Pongo project area."																																		
The Pan American Highway traverses the western boundary of the property. The property is readily																																		
accessible by a series of secondary asphalted and graded roads that lead from the highway to the																																		
"abandoned Acari mine site, which is located 3.5 km east of the claim area. All parts of the claim area"																																		
are easy to reach either along the existing network of secondary roads or by short travel by 4x4 or on																																		
"foot, off existing roads."																																		
"SRK is of the opinion that sufficient surrounding land is available for potential processing plant sites,"																																		
mine and related infrastructure and tailings storage.																																		
There is a 200 kV electrical transmission line running southward from Lima to the port of																																		
"San Nicolas, which serves the Marcona Iron mine beneficiation and pelletizing plant. From there the"																																		
"line extends southeast to the rural community of Bella Union, traversing the Pampa de Pongo"

"property. This is a lower capacity transmission line, rated between 33-66 kV. This existing line"																																		
would require upgrading to service the proposed Pampa de Pongo mine.																																		
Plans to extend the natural gas pipeline south to Nazca and onward to the port of San Juan have been																																		
"finalized. In April 2008, following a tender process, the Peruvian authorities awarded the contract to"																																		
Empresa Energia de Bogota (EEB) and Transportadora de Gas del Interior (TGI). The contract																																		
"stipulates a 30-month completion period (late 2010), which exceeds the requirements for the"																																		
proposed Pampa de Pongo infrastructure																																		
The deep-water port of San Juan is located 38 km by road from the Pampa de Pongo claim boundary.																																		
"The Peruvian authorities are planning to develop the port of San Juan, which would become the"																																		
"largest port in Peru. The port is a naturally sheltered bay, with a current water depth of 8 m at a"																																		
distance of 15 m from shore and a depth of 21 m at a distance of 380 m from shore. Proposed																																		
developments include multiple loading facilities. The tender documents for port development are																																		
expected to be released in the coming months.

"5	History"																																		
"5.1	Deposit Discovery"																																		
"Rio Tinto Mining and Exploration, Sucursal Peru (Rio Tinto) discovered Pampa de Pongo in 1994"																																		
while drill testing a large magnetic anomaly identified by an airborne magnetic-radiometric survey.																																		
"It was a blind target, totally concealed by aeolian sand. The airborne survey was part of a regional"																																		
exploration program designed to identify prospective Iron Oxide Copper Gold (IOCG) targets in the																																		
district. Follow-up drilling by Rio Tinto in 1995 and 1996 identified widespread significant																																		
magnetite mineralization hosted in sedimentary and volcanic rocks. Mineralization occurs in a																																		
northwest-trending structural corridor approximately one kilometre in width and in excess of																																		
12 kilometres long.																																		
"5.1.1	Rio Tinto Exploration"																																		
History of exploration on the Pampa de Pongo property begins with regional exploration by Rio																																		
Tinto which led to its staking. Historical exploration work carried out by Rio Tinto is outlined in																																		
Table 5.1. Portions of this work were directed at identifying potential copper-gold mineralization.																																		
The phases of the exploration program relevant to what was to become the Pampa de Pongo iron-ore																																		
deposit are described in more detail below:

Diamond Drilling	"9 drillholes for 4,883.6m, maximum depth 800.4m"																																	
Metallurgical	2 x 35kg samples for bench-scale metallurgical test work																																	
Rio Tinto Airborne Geophysical Survey																																		
Rio Tinto commissioned a regional helicopter magnetic and radiometric survey. Cardero has access																																		
to survey data coincident with the Pampa de Pongo property.																																		
"Original data has been reviewed, on behalf of Cardero, by Quantec Geoscience, who produced a"																																		
"series of maps including Total magnetic Intensity, Analytical Signal, and 1st Vertical Derivative."																																		
Magnetic data demonstrates good to excellent correlation with mineralized magnetite bodies at																																		
"depth, consequently magnetic data has subsequently been the major driver in exploration at Pampa"

de Pongo. The use of magnetic methods is described more fully in Section 10; however it is suffice																																		
to say that several additional high-priority targets remain to be fully tested.																																		
Rio Tinto Gravity Survey																																		
"Rio Tinto collected measurements at 3,277 gravity stations within the Pampa de Pongo claim block."																																		
"The data was collected on 100-200 metre line spacing, with measurements on 25 metres spacing"																																		
"along lines. Original data has been reviewed, on behalf of Cardero, by Quantec Geoscience, who"																																		
produced a series of maps including Bouguer Anomaly map and a Residual Gravity map. Gravity																																		
"data also shows good correlation with mineralized magnetite bodies at depth, due to the high specific"																																		
"gravity of magnetite, but it does not have sufficient resolution to be used in detailed exploration,"																																		
nevertheless it does highlight several additional target areas for future follow-up exploration																																		
programs

concentrated up to 66-69% iron through a simple Low Intensity Magnetic Separation (LIMS)																																		
"process, with the remaining gangue (waste) material consisting of 2.5-3.0% magnesium oxide (MgO)"																																		
and 0.5-1.5% sulphur. Concentrates were obtained through 3 passes in a magnetic separator and																																		
recoveries are described by Met-Chem as excellent. Concentrates showed a high magnetite content																																		
that normally results in low energy consumption in the firing process. Results are shown in

"Pellets produced from Sample 1 were of good quality and strength, meeting normal commercial"

highly desirable in the natural gas based Direct Reduction processes. Sample 1 contained a slightly

"Additional slagging in the Electric Arc Furnace (EAF) could reduce the MgO content, however the"																																		
high MgO content of the metalized pellet can be an advantage in the steelmaking process as most

"5.1.2	Previous Resource Estimates"																																		
"Helsen (2005) in a report entitled, Geological Valuation Report of the Pampa de Pongo Property,"																																		
"dated August 6, 2005 estimated mineral resources for the Central and South Zones. The available"																																		
magnetic data and 3D magnetic modelling generated at that time resulted in an estimate that was																																		
more liberal than the current SRK resource estimate. The Helsen estimation methodology also used a																																		
less constrained grade envelope to define the mineralized zones used for resource estimation.																																		
Historic mineral resources reported by Helsen are included in the following Table 5.6. SRK is of the																																		
"opinion that the estimate and classification of resources is in accordance with sections 1.2, 1.3 and"																																		
"2.4	of the National Instrument 43-101 and was appropriately based on the data available and"																																		
resulting interpretations made at that time.

"6	Geological Setting"																																		
"The Pampa de Pongo deposit is located in the Marcona (Fe-Cu) District, named after the Marcona"																																		
"Iron mine, which has operated continuously since 1953. The oldest rocks exposed are Precambrian in"																																		
"age and part of the Coastal Basal Complex, consisting of gneisses, potassium-rich granites and"																																		
migmatites that underlie the western and southern parts of the Marcona area (Figure 6.1 Regional																																		
"Geology). At the Mina Justa Deposit - Marcona mine area, this basement metamorphic complex is"																																		
overlain by carbonates and pelitic sediments of the Lower Paleozoic Marcona Formation together																																		
"with marine andesitic to basaltic volcanics (and associated, hypabyssal intrusives), volcaniclastics"																																		
and sediments of the middle to Upper Jurassic Rio Grande Formation and Bella Union Volcanics.																																		
Small remnants of the Upper Jurassic Jahuay Formation (mixed volcanics and sediments) and Lower																																		
"Cretaceous Jauca Formation (sediments) cap the Jurassic succession, as seen in the vicinity of Pampa"																																		
de Pongo. A summarized stratigraphic column for the Marcona District is included (Figure 6.2																																		
Stratigraphic Column).																																		
"Major intrusives include the San Nicolas Batholith, which predates the Jurassic sequence and"																																		
underlies a large tract south and west of the Marcona mine area. The more extensive Lower																																		
Cretaceous Coastal Batholith underlies large areas east of Pampa de Pongo. Abundant intra-mineral																																		
"and post-mineral andesitic dykes, sills and small stocks referred to as “ocoite” are intimately"																																		
associated with the main deposits in the Marcona district and are inferred to signify long-lived																																		
thermal activity associated with high heat flow and transfer of hydrothermal fluids centered over																																		
magmatic sources at depth. The ocoite is generally coarsely porphyritic and contains abundant large																																		
"plagioclase phenocrysts, commonly with reaction rims recording multiple magmatic"																																		
dissolution/overgrowth events.																																		
The majority of the mineralization at the Marcona mine is hosted by carbonates of the Marcona																																		
Formation. The Pampa de Pongo deposit is hosted by the younger Jurassic Juhuay Formation.																																		
"Lithologies, seen in drill core at the fringes of the deposit, include coarse volcaniclastics,"																																		
"conglomerates, banded siltstones, shales, sandstones and carbonate-rich sediments. Within the"																																		
"massive magnetite replacement body, unmineralized remnants are extremely rare. The intersection of"																																		
basement gneisses in some drillholes suggests that the underlying Marcona Formation and Rio																																		
Grande Formation may have been eroded in this part of the district.

"7	Deposit Types"																																		
"It is not proposed here to discuss the Iron Oxide Copper Gold (IOCG) model in any detail, please"																																		
"refer to Sillitoe (2003), the Australian Mineral Foundation volume (2000) and references therein for"																																		
additional information. It is suffice to state that IOCGs are capable of forming in a broad range of																																		
"geotectonic settings (orogenic collapse, anorgenic magmatism and subduction related), that there is"																																		
general consensus regarding their mineralogy and alteration facies but that debate is ongoing																																		
regarding their parental fluid sources. These may be paraphrased as an ‘external’ brine / evaporate																																		
"model (Barton et al, 2003) versus a purely magmatic model as eloquently discussed by Sillitoe"																																		
"(2003), finally Hitzman and co-workers propose a hybrid mixing (magmatic and external evaporitic"																																		
fluids) model (2003).																																		
"Globally, IOCG deposits can vary between vein-style deposits, hydrothermal breccias, replacement"																																		
"mantos or massive replacements. In general, IOCG deposits display close spatial and temporal"																																		
relationships with plutonic complexes and spatially associated fault systems.																																		
The mineral deposits and showings located in the Marcona District have many of the defining																																		
characteristics of the iron oxide copper-gold (IOCG) class of deposits. Within this broadly defined																																		
"deposit-type, the Marcona District deposits can be sub-categorized as hosting both iron dominated /"																																		
Kiruna-type mineralization (dominated by magnetite mineralization such as Marcona Mine and																																		
Pampa de Pongo) and copper rich IOCG deposits (Mina Justa). Large Mesozoic IOCG systems are																																		
actively mined along the western coast of South America and include Chilean deposits such as																																		
"Candaleria, Punta Del Cobre and Manto Verde; and Peruvian deposits such as Raul Condestable,"																																		
"Mina Justa, Marcona and Pampa de Pongo."																																		
Pampa de Pongo exhibits replacement of original host volcano-sedimentary lithologies by massive																																		
"magnetite. At Pampa de Pongo, iron oxides are the principal ore-forming minerals (hematite,"																																		
"magnetite or martite) with anomalous secondary copper and gold. To date, no economic"																																		
"accumulations of copper have been discovered, however, the potential for future copper-gold"																																		
discoveries has not been ruled out.

"8	Mineralization"																																		
Magnetite mineralization at Pampa de Pongo was originally discovered following an airborne																																		
"magnetic survey and subsequent drill testing. Since the initial discovery, detailed ground magnetic"																																		
surveys and 3D magnetic inversion models have formed a critical component of exploration at																																		
Pampa de Pongo with a strong correlation between the highest magnetic susceptibility (as defined by																																		
"the 3D inversion models) and significant magnetic mineralization intersected in drillholes. To date,"																																		
two inferred resources (Central Zone and South Zone) have been defined through drill-testing of																																		
"magnetic anomalies. A third target (East Zone) has had only one drill test, which intersected 292"																																		
metres of semi-massive and massive magnetite mineralization at the extreme edge of a 3D magnetic																																		
anomaly. The remainder of this high-priority anomaly remains untested but it is estimated to																																		
represent potential for an additional 350-500 Mt of magnetite mineralization. A fourth high-priority																																		
anomaly (North Zone) remains completely untested.																																		
At Pampa de Pongo the mineralized bodies are semi-concordant and appear to have been controlled																																		
"by a number of factors, primarily structure, but also host rock lithologies, primary porosity and"																																		
secondary porosity related to fracturing or brecciation. Mineralization comprises semi-massive to																																		
massive magnetite replacement zones with minor sulphides (pyrite-pyrrhotite-chalcopyrite ± minor																																		
"marcasite, bornite, arsenopyrite, sphalerite and galena) and minor specular hematite. Alteration"																																		
"minerals include apatite, serpentine, talc, epidote, chlorite, magnesite, dolomite, calcite, actinolite,"																																		
"albite, tourmaline, garnet, phlogopite, biotite, sericite and K-spar."																																		
"There are four main zones of mineralization and potential mineralization, which can be observed on"																																		
the Total Magnetic Intensity (TMI) map (Figure 8.1). Details of magnetic interpretation and 3D																																		
magnetic modeling are fully explained in Section10. The four zones are:																																		
North Zone -Untested Exploration Target																																		
The North Zone is a high-priority magnetic exploration target. The large 3D magnetic anomaly																																		
"measures 1,000 metres north-south by 1060 metres east-west at its widest point. Target depth is"																																		
"estimated to be 600 metres, but only drill testing will determine the true extent of the anomaly."																																		
"Drilling to date in the North Zone of the property has been shallow, targeting copper-gold targets and"																																		
completed prior to detailed magnetic surveying.																																		
Central Zone																																		
"The Central Zone is a two-layer mineralized body. The lower portion consists of a flat-lying, massive"																																		
"replacement lens up to 370 metres thick, measuring 1,060 metres east-west by 1,000 metres north-"																																		
"south at the widest point. Mineralization remains open. Mineralization is consistent, averaging"																																		
approximately 62% magnetite with multiple intersections greater than 80% magnetite. In the																																		
"overlying upper portion, predominantly massive iron mineralization is cut with a minor component"																																		
"of hypabyssal porphyry sills. The lower, high-grade massive replacement at Pampa de Pongo, based"

"on current drill results, is almost completely devoid of unmineralized intrusive rocks. Continuity of"																																		
high grade mineralization within this zone is very strong down-hole and between drillhole intercepts.																																		
East Zone -Advanced Exploration																																		
The East Zone was first delineated following detailed ground magnetic surveying in 2008. The																																		
"anomaly has a footprint measuring 1,860 metres north-south by 650 metres east-west. The southern"																																		
"edge of the anomaly was partially tested by a Rio Tinto drillhole in 1996 (drillhole PPD-004), which"																																		
intersected very significant massive magnetite mineralization. Mineralization consists of																																		
"3 high-grade mineralized lenses, including 86 metres (from 276-362 metres) at 41.38% iron,"																																		
"66 metres (from 470-536 metres) at 44.28% iron, and 23.9 metres (from 609.2-633.1 metres) at"																																		
"42.36% iron. A broader, continuous 292-metre interval grading 30.85% iron was intersected from"																																		
268-558 metres. Mineralization is shallow at 276 metres from surface.																																		
South Zone																																		
The South Zone is comprised of two separate lenses of mineralization. These near-surface zones																																		
consist predominantly of massive magnetite mineralization. The South 1 (“S1”) Zone measures																																		
700 metres north-south by 900 metres east-west at the widest point with a true thickness of up to																																		
"120 metres, while the South 2 (“S2”) Zone measures 250 metres north-south by 500 m east-west at"																																		
the widest point with a true thickness of 30 metres. Mineralization remains open in all directions.																																		
The upper portion of the deposit has been eroded. Geologically younger Quaternary to recent cover																																		
"material is comprised of semi-lithified sandstones and conglomerates, ranging from 80-300 metres"																																		
thick. The resource has not been included in the mine schedule presented in this report and represents																																		
"future upside potential. Additional exploration is planned, targeting potentially shallower"																																		
"mineralization, which contingent on results, may later be added to the Central Zone mine plan and"																																		
schedule.

Exploration and drilling for magnetite iron mineralization has been driven by ground magnetic

helicopter regional magnetic survey.																																		
"Cardero initiated a detailed survey in 2004, covering the areas now termed the Central and South"																																		
"Zones. In 2008, a second survey was initiated to infill the remainder of the prospective ground,"																																		
screening for additional magnetic anomalies. Data for both surveys was collected by																																		
Quantec Geoscience Peru S.A.C. using two GEM Systems - GSM-19 Overhauser magnetometers.																																		
The GSM-19 magnetometers measure the magnetic field of the earth to an accuracy of 0.01

"An inversion is a mathematical procedure, which utilizes measurements taken at surface, generating"																																		
3D sub-surface models based on certain assumptions. The inversion models characterize how the																																		
"relevant physical property, in this case magnetic susceptibility, will be distributed in three"																																		
"dimensions below the ground surface. At Pampa de Pongo, the measurements being utilized are the"																																		
surface magnetic data. The assumptions were based on hard information gathered from Rio Tinto’s																																		
"previous drilling, which had intersected massive magnetite at known depths below surface. In the"

"case of Pampa de Pongo, there is a very large geophysical contrast between the magnetic"																																		
susceptibility of massive magnetite mineralization and unmineralized rock.																																		
The magnetic data was inverted by Quantec Geoscience Peru S.A.C. using a 3D inversion package

the Central and South Zones are located at differing depths and have significantly different																																		
"thicknesses of high grade iron mineralization, which all lead to differences in magnetic response."																																		
"In order to reveal a better correlation, the sub-surface mineralization must be overlain on ‘slices’ cut"																																		
horizontally through the 3D Inversion model. The image in Figure 9.1 is a horizontal slice through																																		
the inversion model at a depth of 600 metres below surface and demonstrates excellent correlation																																		
between the Central Zone resource and the inversion model. This model also includes the area of the																																		
"East Zone exploration target, where by analogy, magnetite mineralization is interpreted to be located"																																		
within the area of the dashed line. Drillhole DDH-004 tested the edge of this anomaly and intersected																																		
a continuous 292 metres of semi-massive to massive magnetite mineralization.																																		
Comparison of drill intercepts obtained to date indicate a high correlation between modeled magnetic																																		
anomalies using MAG3D and magnetite mineralization intersected in drillholes. As a result there is a																																		
good probability of intersecting further magnetite mineralization in the East and North Zones.																																		
"At Pampa de Pongo, magnetic inversions work extremely well imaging magnetic anomalies from"																																		
"surface to the base of mineralization. As with many mathematical models, the model is not resolved"																																		
"accurately at depth. Therefore, the 3D models appear to continue at depth, beyond the known limits"																																		
of magnetite mineralization (Figure 9.2). For SRK’s resource estimate solids were terminated at the																																		
depth of drilling marked by the dashed line for the Central Zone. For conceptual tonnage estimate for																																		
the East Zone the depth extent of the average of the range in reported tonnage roughly approximates

The 2004 Cardero drill program was primarily targeted towards copper-gold discovery at relatively																																		
shallow depth. The majority of drillholes were not drilled to sufficient depth to test what is now																																		
known to be a significant iron resource. All drillhole locations are included in Figure 10.1 with																																		
results summarized in Table 10.1.																																		
"All drillholes were collared in HQ-size core, reducing to NQ at a depth of approximately"																																		
300-400 metres from surface and reducing further to BQ as dictated by ground and drilling																																		
conditions.																																		
"10.1	Iron Intersections"																																		
Drillhole DDH04-PP019 (South Zone) and drillholes DDH04-PP020A and DDH04-PP021																																		
(Central Zone) were drilled to test the 3D magnetic anomaly. All three drillholes intersected massive																																		
magnetite mineralization as predicted by the 3D magnetic model. The best mineralization was in																																		
"drillhole DDH04-PP021, which intersected 303 metres at 51.2% iron. The focus of this report is the"																																		
"iron resource in Central Zone, consequently only iron intersections from Central Zone are described"																																		
here.																																		
Drillholes DDH04-PP020A and DDH04-PP021 tested the central portion of Central Zone																																		
(Figures 10.2 and 10.3). Drillhole DDH04-PP020A intersected a continuous interval of semi-massive																																		
to massive magnetite mineralization from 314.75 metres to 626 metres (311.25 metres total).																																		
Drillhole DDH04-PP021 intersected continuous semi-massive to massive mineralization in a 303-																																		
metre interval grading 51.2% iron.																																		
Drillholes DDH04-PP020A and DDH04-PP021 both intersected significant iron mineralization in																																		
the zones overlying the massive mineralization as outlined above. These intersections are comprised																																		
"primarily of massive mineralization, which has been intruded by unmineralized hypabyssal sills. The"																																		
best mineralization intersected to date in the upper portion of the system was in drillhole																																		
DDH04-PP021 returning 347 metres at 22.5% iron.

"10.2	Copper-Gold Intersections"																																		
Exploration to date has identified several significant copper-gold intersections. Drillhole																																		
DDH04-PP010 intersected 49.2 metres at 0.32% copper and 0.34 g/t gold. Drillhole DDH04-PP016																																		
"intersected fault breccias over 33.2 metres (from 154.3 to 187.5 metres), within which 19.3 metres"																																		
"(from 154.3 to 173.6 metres) returned 0.88 g/t gold. In addition, Rio Tinto’s reverse circulation"																																		
"drillhole, PRC-002, intersected 21 metres at 0.43% copper and 0.68 g/t gold."																																		
"Other broad, low-grade copper intersections drilled by Cardero include drillhole DDH04-PP019"																																		
"(187.55 metres at 0.17% copper and 0.28 g/t gold), drillhole DDH04-PP020A (292.0 metres at"																																		
0.16% copper and 0.11 g/t gold) and drillhole DDH04-PP021 (302.0 metres at 0.10% copper and																																		
0.06 g/t gold).																																		
The potential for higher-grade copper-gold mineralization is not fully understood at present but the																																		
"potential for future copper-gold discoveries has not been ruled out. Regardless, broad, low-grade"																																		
copper-gold intersections have very significant value in the Pampa de Pongo preliminary economic																																		
assessment as by-product credits.

"11	Sampling Method and Approach"																																		
The HQ and NQ core from both the Cardero and Rio Tinto drill programs was sawn in half and																																		
sampled. The HQ core size was downsized at approximately the 300-400 metres depth as required by																																		
"drilling conditions. As part of SRK’s due diligence sit visit, it was observed that the remaining half"																																		
core from both drill programs was appropriately stored at a secure maintenance yard belonging to																																		
"Geotec. Drilling Ltd in Lima, Peru. Drill core for both programs had been sampled over the entire"																																		
drillhole extents. This sampling protocol reflected the nature of semi-massive and massive magnetite																																		
encountered throughout the drilling. In both drill programs sample lengths averaged 2.0 m with																																		
sample lengths ranging from 0.2 to 3.7 metres. Sample intervals selected were based on the presence																																		
of magnetite or alteration.																																		
"Although Rio Tinto had completed both diamond drilling and reverse circulation, only diamond drill"																																		
results were used for the estimation of the Pampa de Pongo mineral resources. The reverse																																		
circulation drillholes generally failed to achieve sufficient depth to penetrate the mineralization. The																																		
Cardero drill program was comprised entirely of diamond drill core.																																		
Drillhole spacing for the entire combined Rio Tinto and Cardero database ranges from 190 m to																																		
"1500 m, with a majority in the 200-400 m range. The density of drilling of the Rio Tinto and Cardero"																																		
drill programs are roughly proportional and both cover the same Central and South Zone areas. Only																																		
one hole penetrates the southern extent of the East Zone. The distance from the South Zone to the																																		
North Zone represents an interpreted strike extent of approximately 9 km at an azimuth of 326																																		
degrees. This trend roughly follows the interpretation of a deep seated fault structure which																																		
controlled the emplacement of mineralization.

SRK believes that the samples are representative and that there are no known factors which may																																		
have resulted in sample bias.

"12	Sample Preparation, Analyses and Security"																																		
"12.1	Rio Tinto"																																		
It is assumed by SRK that Rio Tinto employees were responsible for the collection of samples during																																		
"the Rio Tinto phase of drilling. It is unknown what sample preparation, assaying or security"																																		
protocols were followed by Rio Tinto during the 1994-1996 phase of exploration. It would appear																																		
from available assay certificates that Bondar-Clegg Laboratories and Anamet Services Laboratories																																		
"of Bristol, UK were used to assay the Rio Tinto samples. It is not clear whether the Bondar Clegg"																																		
laboratory was certified at the time the Rio Tinto program was in operation. The Anamet Services																																		
laboratory at the time of assaying was part of the Rio Tinto Group. Assay certificates indicate that																																		
"assay methods FA01, G02 ICP04 and XRF04 were used however no other details were available."																																		
The assay certificates also indicate that assay procedures were adopted which followed the National																																		
"measurement Accreditation Service (NAMAS). During the Rio Tinto program, it is reported that the"																																		
assay laboratories did undertake quality control measures.																																		
"12.2	Cardero"																																		
Collection of samples from the Cardero 2004-2005 drill core was completed by employees of																																		
Cardero under the supervision of G.D. Belik who acted as Cardero’s on site QP. No sample																																		
preparation was completed on site other than the sawing of core. Belik indicates that the logging of																																		
core and sawing of samples were completed in a secure core logging facility in the local village of																																		
"Lomas. Samples were delivered directly to the ALS-Chemex laboratory in Lima, Peru in sealed"																																		
containers.																																		
Sample preparation and gold analysis were completed by ALS-Chemex Laboratories in Lima.																																		
"Sample preparation was comprised of weighing, crushing to 70% passing 2mm, followed by splitting"																																		
and pulverizing the split to 85% passing 75 micron. Pulps were then transported to ALS-Chemex																																		
"Vancouver, B.C. for multi-element ICP analysis. Gold analysis by ALS-Chemex (Lima) was"																																		
comprised of fire assay of a 30 gram pulp followed by an atomic absorption spectroscopy finish. For																																		
"higher grade samples (>10,000ppb) fire assay with a gravimetric finish was used."																																		
Analysis at ALS-Chemex varied over the Cardero drill program. Analysis was comprised of																																		
ALS-Chemex sample method ME-CP81 whereby the sample undergoes a sodium peroxide fusion at																																		
650°C followed by acid dissolution of the pellet and is finished with																																		
Inductively Coupled Plasma-Atomic Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-AES) reading. ALS-Chemex																																		
sample method ME-ICP41 was also used for more weakly mineralized intervals. This method adopts																																		
an aqua regia leach and may not be an optimal method as it only represents the leachable portion of																																		
the analyte. Incomplete acid digestion may result in the underreporting of some elements.																																		
ALS-Chemex has developed and implemented at each of its locations a Quality Management System																																		
designed to ensure the production of consistently reliable data. The system is audited both internally

and externally. Most ALS-Chemex laboratories are registered or are pending registration to																																		
ISO9001:2000 and a number of analytical facilities have received ISO 17025 accreditations for																																		
specific laboratory procedures. The ALS-Chemex Lima Laboratory has the Bureau Veritas Quality																																		
International ISO 9001:2000 Certification and the INDECOPI 17025 Accreditation. The																																		
ALS-Chemex Vancouver Laboratory is in compliance with ISO 9001:2000 for the provision of assay																																		
services according to QMI Management Systems Registration. The laboratory has also been																																		
accredited to ISO 7025 standards for specific laboratory procedures by the Standards Council of																																		
Canada (SCC).

"13	Data Verification"																																		
Data verification was evaluated by SRK for the purposes of this Technical Report. Verification was																																		
"comprised of checking 5% of the electronic database against assay certificates, evaluating Rio Tinto"																																		
and ALS-Chemex’s internal quality control measures during the course of assaying and assessing the																																		
results of a total of 39 quarter core splits from both the RT and Cardero drill programs. No pulps or																																		
coarse rejects were available for independent check assaying for either the Rio Tinto or Cardero																																		
sample programs.																																		
No material issues were noted with Rio Tinto’s QA/QC results. Rio Tinto’s QA/QC program was																																		
comprised of the insertion of blanks and standards and analysis of duplicate pulps by Rio Tinto																																		
"personnel. Blanks were inserted at an average rate of 1 per 100 samples, while standards were"																																		
inserted at a rate of 1 per 33 samples and duplicates were assayed at a frequency of 1 per 12 samples.																																		
Rio Tinto used a total of 10 different standards. Blanks and standards showed no indication of																																		
contamination. Duplicate results indicated no material issues with the assay results.																																		
No issues were identified with the Cardero assay program % core duplicates or the ALS-Chemex																																		
"internal QA/QC results, however, % core duplicates for the Rio Tinto program did indicate some"																																		
"issues surrounding the quality of the deleterious grades such as P, MgO, Mn, and the alkalis. As a"																																		
"result, the Rio Tinto MgO, Al2O3, Mn and alkali grade seemed to consistently under-report grade"																																		
when compared to the duplicate quartered core. It is suspected that the assay method used by Rio																																		
"Tinto was likely an ICP assay method which suffered from incomplete acid digestion. As well, P"																																		
values in the original Rio Tinto dataset were significantly higher than the % core duplicates selected																																		
by SRK suggesting the potential for laboratory error. This finding was also supported by subsequent																																		
metallurgical testwork that showed that higher P values from Rio Tinto assaying were not replicated																																		
"As a result of the analysis, SRK elected to not use the MgO, Mn, Al2O3, P, K2O, Na2O and TiO2"																																		
"values from Rio Tinto for resource estimation. The Fe, S, SiO2, CaO, Au and Cu grades were"																																		
unaffected and showed good reproducibility considering the samples were comparing duplicate																																		
quarter splits of core rather than duplicate pulps.																																		
"Results from the Fe, S, SiO2, CaO Au and Cu % core duplicates are included below. The lower"																																		
correlation of Cu and Au are interpreted to be acceptable because of the more variable grade																																		
distribution of copper and gold and typical variance expected with % core duplicates.

The Pampa de Pongo concentrator will process approximately 27 million tonnes per year of																																		
"mineralized rock (approximately 75,000 tonnes per day) at 40-45% average iron grade that will be"																																		
used to produce 15 million tonnes per year of iron ore pellets.																																		
Equipment sizing is based on information published from the Cerro Verde mine																																		
"(Vanderbeek et. Al 2006), built in Peru and commissioned in January 2007. The Cerro Verde"																																		
concentrator has 1/3 higher throughput than needed for the Pampa de Pongo concentrator and																																		
"processes 108,000 mtpd of crude ore having a 15.3 kWhr/t Bond work index. In comparison, the"																																		
"Pampa de Pongo concentrator will process about the same amount or 75,000 mtpd of ROM rock with"																																		
"a somewhat higher Bond work index of 17.4 kWhr/t (measured 15.8 kWhr/st by NRRI, June 2008)."																																		
Primary (Gyratory) Crushing																																		
Run of mine (ROM) mineralized rock will be fed to a 60-inch by 113-inch primary gyratory crusher																																		
with approximately a 1000 - 1200 hp motor that will be installed in a conventional fixed structure																																		
with a 500 tonne capacity dump pocket. Crushed ROM will be reclaimed from the primary crusher																																		
"product surge pocket by three apron feeders per conveyor, installed in a separate concrete reclaim"																																		
tunnels beneath the stockpile and hence to the coarse rock conveyor. The coarse rock conveyor will																																		
"discharge to a ROM stockpile with 45,000 tonne live capacity, 190,000 tonne dead capacity and"																																		
"300,000 tonne ultimate capacity (to be pushed via a bulldozer). The ROM conveyor will consist of"																																		
two conveyors in series to allow for metal detection and removal without shutting down the entire																																		
secondary crushing plant.																																		
Grinding																																		
"Ore will be reclaimed from the ROM stockpile by three apron feeders per conveyor, feeding two"																																		
parallel SAG feed conveyors. The apron feeders and SAG feed conveyors are located in separate																																		
"concrete tunnels installed below the ROM stockpile. Each of the two, parallel SAG feed conveyors"																																		
in turn feeds one 40-by-22 foot SAG mill powered by a 22 MW gearless drive. Each SAG mill																																		
"discharges onto a single 3.0-by-7.3 metre double deck, low head, banana type screen. SAG screen"																																		
undersize material is combined with the discharge from two ball mills in a common sump and is																																		
pumped with two operating 28-by-26 inch variable speed pumps to separate ball mill cyclone																																		
clusters. Each SAG mill feeds two ball mills. Cyclone underflow from each cyclone cluster reports																																		
by gravity to a 24-by-35 foot ball mill powered by a 12 MW gearless drive. Cyclone overflow																																		
reports to rougher magnetic separation. SAG screen oversize is conveyed to the pebble crushing

Magnetic Separation																																		
A typical magnetic separator concentrate line can produce about 1 million tons per year of																																		
"concentrate. Therefore, producing the 15 million tonnes per year of concentrate will require 15 lines."																																		
Each of the fifteen concentrator lines will start with five 48-inch diameter by 10-foot long rougher																																		
wet magnetic separators. Rougher concentrate from the five units will feed two finisher magnetic																																		
separators of the same dimensions as the roughers.																																		
Sulphur Removal																																		
The magnetite concentrate contains 1.5% sulphur. During pilot-scale metallurgical work (detailed																																		
"below), sulphur was not removed by flotation prior to pelletizing. However, sulphur levels were not"																																		
found to be an issue for final pellet quality. Most or all of the sulphur was released during induration.																																		
Potential overheating of pellets during induration due to sulphur oxidation is a possible future																																		
concern and sulphur may therefore need to be removed for metallurgical reasons.																																		
Sulphur removal by flotation is part of the proposed beneficiation flowsheet (Figure 15.1). A																																		
"sulphide froth flotation circuit will float off sulphide minerals, concentrating the magnetite in the"																																		
underflow. This sulphide product will contain payable by-product copper and gold. The process flow																																		
"sheet and equipment specifications are yet to be determined. However, based on typical copper"																																		
"residence time for a low-grade feed, and a total throughput of 27 million tonnes per annum, a"																																		
flotation circuit of approximately 2500 cubic metres (total float capacity) would be anticipated. This																																		
float circuit would be based upon large Tank cells for the roughers with the cleaner circuits being																																		
"based upon Tank, or conventional, cells depending upon the concentration ratio. Concentrates and"																																		
"tailings will be thickened for water reclamation and re-cycle, while the concentrates will be filtered"																																		
on conventional filters to generate a copper-gold concentrate for marketing. Laboratory testing is																																		
underway and preliminary results suggest that a copper concentrate will be achievable.																																		
Magnetic Concentrate																																		
Finisher magnetic concentrate from each concentrator line will be pumped to one of two concentrate																																		
slurry thickeners to increase slurry density to required levels of approximately 60% solids. The																																		
overflow from the two thickeners will be recycled as concentrator process water. The underflow																																		
from each of the two thickeners will pass through a demagnetizing coil then travel several kilometres																																		
through a slurry pipeline from the concentrator to the pellet plant concentrate slurry tank. This slurry																																		
pipeline will therefore handle 15 million tonnes per year (mtpy) of concentrate at 60% solids. Flux																																		
addition will occur at the concentrate slurry tank and will come from a separate flux supply system.																																		
Filtering aids can be dosed into two concentrate slurry tanks. The concentrate slurry tank underflow																																		
will be split into two separate pipelines where each portion feeds a distributor to distribute feed to up																																		
to ten (thirty total) vacuum disk filters. The filtrate from the vacuum disk filters will be recycled via																																		
a second pipeline back to the concentrator’s slurry thickener to recover any concentrate that reports																																		
to the filtrate. This secondary pipeline will need to handle approximately 9 mtpy of water.

Tailings																																		
Both the rougher and finisher magnetic separator tailings will be processed with a sulphide froth																																		
flotation circuit to concentrate the copper and gold (overflow froth product) that will be vacuum																																		
filtered to produce a copper-gold concentrate. The tailings from the copper / gold separation will be																																		
sent to a clarifier where the underflow will be sent to a tailings basin and the overflow water will be																																		
recycled to the mill.																																		
"15.1.2	Pelletization"																																		
Balling																																		
Vacuum disk filters will be controlled to produce an iron ore concentrate that contains an appropriate																																		
level of moisture (approximately 7-9%) to produce acceptable quality green balls. The concentrate																																		
will be distributed by a bin supply system to any of twenty-four balling lines. Each balling line will																																		
consist of a filtered concentrate day bin each with a table feeder and a 12-foot diameter by 32-foot																																		
long balling drum equipped with roll screens. Bentonite (dosed at approximately 7 kilograms per																																		
tonne of concentrate) and/or an alternate binder will be added to the moist concentrate prior to																																		
balling. Roll screen undersize (“seeds”) will be recycled to the drum until they achieve product size																																		
(approximately three passes) and oversize will be pulverized and returned to the balling drum.																																		
Induration																																		
Four of the twenty-four balling lines will each feed one of six four-metre wide traveling grate																																		
induration machines that will each produce 2.5 million tonnes per year of indurated iron ore pellets.																																		
A roll feeder will distribute wet green pellets at an even depth across the grates and also allow for																																		
wet green pellet fines to be removed and recycled to the concentrate bin supply. In terms of fuel																																		
"consumption, approximately 320,000 BTU of natural gas per metric ton of pellets will be consumed"																																		
"during induration (heat hardening). In terms of water consumption, approximately 91.5 gallons per"																																		
minute wet wall electrostatic precipitator evaporative losses are anticipated.

The purpose of the pilot-scale pelletizing investigation was to demonstrate that the Pampa de Pongo																																		
mineralized rocks are suitable for production of a quality Blast Furnace (BF) grade and premium																																		
Direct Reduction (DR) grade pellet. DR pellets are premium products and typically attract higher																																		
value contracts than BF grade pellets. The price premium is typically 10% in terms of contract price																																		
and most industry analysts agree that this trend should continue in the long term. BF and DR																																		
metallurgy was undertaken at two separate laboratories.																																		
"15.2.1	Testing Facilities"

"in Minnesota, United States. NRRI was selected because their personnel bring previous experience"

"throughout the world, including the magnetic taconites in Michigan and Minnesota in the"																																		
United States and in Canada. NRRI are generally considered to be industry leaders in this type of test																																		
work.																																		
The Direct Reduction material evaluation test work was undertaken by MIDREX® Technologies																																		
"Inc., North Carolina, USA. MIDREX® is the world leader in DRI technology, having built more than"																																		
"60 modules in 19 countries, and has become the leading process technology for producing Direct"																																		
Reduced Iron (DRI) with more than 60% of the world’s DRI produced using MIDREX®																																		
Technology.																																		
"15.2.2	Sample Selection"																																		
The sample for metallurgical testing was selected from existing drill core from within the Central																																		
"Zone, which is the focus of this study. SRK determined the length-weighted mean grade of the zone"																																		
and recommended sample intervals which would comprise a representative sample. Samples were																																		
"taken from 4 drillholes (DDH-001, -003, -020A, and -021), totalling 359 metres of mineralized"																																		
"quartered drill core. The sample was shipped from Peru as two batches, each representative of the"																																		
determined mean grade of the central zone. The first sample (producing 450 kilograms of																																		
concentrate) was used for initial bench-scale testing. The unused material was added to the second																																		
"batch. The total weight of the sample was 1,090 kilograms."																																		
"15.3	NRRI Metallurgical Testing"																																		
"Beneficiation, magnetic concentration and pilot-scale pelletizing was undertaken at NRRI."																																		
"15.3.1	Metallurgical Test Results"																																		
The initial step in the metallurgical testing process was to produce a suitable grade iron ore																																		
concentrate from drill core samples then subsequently produce iron ore pellets for further																																		
metallurgical testing. Magnetic separation produced a 65.5% iron concentrate with a total iron																																		
recovery of 93.4%. This was achieved with only a simple two stage (rougher-cleaner) wet magnetic																																		
separation.																																		
Bench scale testing was used to establish conditions for pilot plant operation. Batch balling and mini-																																		
pot induration testing were used to provide a basis for pilot-scale full pot grate tests. Mini-pot test																																		
results are a good indicator of physical BF pellet quality and provide guidance for designing the full																																		
pot grate test plan. Full pot grate tests represent the conditions in a commercial plant and the																																		
"physical, chemical, and metallurgical results are scalable to commercial operation; full pot grate tests"																																		
also provide the opportunity to correlate pellet quality with the furnace firing cycle for quality																																		
"optimization. It was noted that the Pampa de Pongo concentrate balled very well, meaning good"																																		
growth rate and moisture control at all levels of additive. Since the amount of concentrate was																																		
"relatively limited, a generic induration furnace temperature cycle was selected; however it was not"

completely developed to provide optimum pellet quality and NRRI fully expects further																																		
improvements would result from additional metallurgical test work.																																		
"Four full pot grate samples were fired, with the initial test being used to provide a baseline firing"																																		
cycle for the subsequent three. The resulting fired pilot-scale pellet quality averaged 421 pounds																																		
compression strength and 94.3% of material sizing >1/4 inch after the tumble test. The metallurgical																																		
"quality shows reducibility (0.94%/min.), swelling (10.8%) and porosity (27.0%) that all meet"																																		
industry standards for high quality blast furnace feed.																																		
"Because concentrate quantity was limited, further development of the pot grate cycle was stopped"																																		
"after the fourth pot grate test. According to the NRRI report, if sufficient material had been available"																																		
"(from a larger sample of drill core), the preheat cycle time would have been modified and"																																		
significantly higher pellet quality could have been obtained.																																		
"15.3.2	Blast Furnace End-User Considerations"																																		
Blast furnace operations generally source pellets globally through a network of purchasers.																																		
Operations are typically seeking the best pellet chemistry at the least cost to meet their needs and it is																																		
important that pellet chemistry be highly consistent. There are a number of specific needs that are																																		
relevant to the Pampa de Pongo pellet chemistry.																																		
Deleterious Elements																																		
"Deleterious elements in iron ores and concentrates include silica, alumina, manganese, phosphorous,"																																		
"alkalis (such as sodium and potassium), and sulphur. All iron ore pellet producers have to contend"																																		
"with at least one of these elements, with almost all having a primary concern to reduce the silica"																																		
content.																																		
"•	Silica is the deleterious element that a beneficiation plant is usually designed to reduce. Modern"																																		
plants employ additional ore grinding and froth flotation procedures so as to reduce silica.																																		
"Pampa de Pongo concentrate contains some of the lowest silica available within the industry, and"																																		
achieves this without additional beneficiation steps. Typical commercial iron ore pellets have																																		
silica ranging from 2.7 to 5.4 %.																																		
"•	Pelletizing of Pampa de Pongo concentrate produced pellets with significantly lower silica levels"																																		
of 1.65% (bench-scale) to 2.23% (pilot-scale). Bench-scale testing demonstrated that with																																		
"limited additional grinding, the silica in the concentrate could be reduced even further to as low"																																		
as 0.34% at a reasonable particle size of 60% minus 200 mesh (75 um) with only a simple two																																		
stage wet magnetic separation. The low-silica Pampa de Pongo pellet can allow a blast furnace																																		
operation to use higher silica (poorer quality) pellets or a higher proportion of their standard																																		
silica pellets without supplementing additional flux reagents.																																		
"•	Phosphorous content in iron at concentrations greater than 0.2% makes the product cold short (or"																																		
"brittle at low temperatures). In steel making, the product becomes brittle even with only 0.5%"																																		
"phosphorous. The phosphorous cannot be easily removed by fluxing, so it is critical that the iron"

Pampa de Pongo PEA																																		
Page 49																																		
ore be low in phosphorous. The Pampa de Pongo pellets contain only 0.004% phosphorous and																																		
should be highly desirable to most end-users.																																		
"•	Sulphur is a frequent contaminant in coal and sometimes in iron ore. Sulphur causes iron to hot"																																		
short (or become brittle when hot). This means that the iron must be worked at lower																																		
"temperature, which requires more energy. Commercial iron ore pellets should contain less than"																																		
0.05% sulphur. The Pampa de Pongo pilot-scale pellets contain only 0.008% sulphur and are a																																		
premium product in that respect.																																		
"•	Alumina is difficult to reduce so contamination of iron in the blast furnace is not a serious"																																		
"problem. However, aluminium does increase the viscosity of the slag, which can create"																																		
difficulties in operation of the furnace. Viscous slag slows the descent of the charge in the																																		
"furnace and prolongs the process, consuming more energy in the blast furnace. Al2O3 should"																																		
typically be less than 2.5% and Pampa de Pongo pellets contain 1% Al2O3.																																		
Fluxed Pellets																																		
Fluxed iron ore pellets are made by adding magnesium and/or calcium in the form of limestone and																																		
dolomite to the pelletizing feed mix. The lime and /or dolomite additions are made to improve blast																																		
"furnace operation, hot metal sulphur control and furnace refractory life."																																		
Pellet producers are forced to pay extra for dolomite or limestone to produce fluxed pellets; therefore																																		
fluxed (basic) pellets are more costly to produce than standard (acid) pellets. Magnesium is naturally																																		
occurring in the Pampa de Pongo concentrate and behaves in a similar way to calcium in that it has a																																		
high affinity for sulphur at steelmaking temperatures and can also be beneficial in mitigating erosion																																		
of the magnesite steelmaking furnace refractory by liquid slag.																																		
"At lower induration furnace temperatures (<1300 o C), calcium has a higher affinity for sulphur than"																																		
"magnesium. Therefore, a high calcium pellet can trap sulphur and pass it along into the product"																																		
"pellet. However, a high magnesium / low calcium pellet will allow the sulphur contained in the iron"																																		
ore concentrate to pass along with the furnace gases thus yielding a low sulphur iron ore pellet. This																																		
"is important for blast furnace pellets, but particularly important for the higher premium Direct"																																		
Reduction (DR) grade pellets since sulphur in these pellets can poison the catalyst required for the																																		
process and sulphur embrittles steel.																																		
The magnesium level within the Pampa de Pongo concentrate will be viewed by most blast furnace																																		
operations as being a very desirable feature. Pampa de Pongo pellets can also be viewed as a																																		
premium blending feedstock material as it promotes the use of cheaper acid pellets (low ratio of																																		
percentages of [CaO+MgO]/[SiO2+Al2O3]) so that an optimum low cost feed to the blast furnace can																																		
be determined. Typical fluxed pellets contain 1.2 to 1.8% MgO. The Pampa de Pongo pellets contain																																		
a more favourable 3.6% MgO.																																		
"In addition, if a steelmaker so desires, the Pampa de Pongo pellets can be customized to produce"																																		
designer pellets by controlling the silica level (from as low as 0.34% to 2.3% or higher) by simply

controlling the amount of grinding of the concentrate and/or creating a pellet recipe and adding other																																		
additives or fluxes to the concentrate to provide the desired chemistry.																																		
"15.3.3	Chemical Analysis and Quality Control"																																		
A representative sample from each of the full pot grate fired pellets was tested to determine their																																		
"physical qualities and characteristics. Based on these results, the remaining representative pellets"																																		
from pot grate tests 2 through 4 were combined into one bulk representative sample and chemistry																																		
was determined from a representative sub-sample. Analysis from the final Pampa de Pongo pellets is																																		
"presented in Table 15.1 below and compared to typical Blast Furnace chemical composition, where"																																		
such estimations can be reasonably made. All of the analysis was undertaken at the NRRI laboratory.																																		
NRRI follow international (ISO) and North American (ASTM) procedures where such procedures																																		
exist for highly specialized iron pelletizing work.																																		
"In order to ensure quality control, a duplicate check sample was forwarded to ALS-Chemex in"																																		
Vancouver for ISO-certified XRF analysis. Results from ALS-Chemex are also presented in																																		
Table 15.1 and were all found to be within acceptable limits of accuracy and precision.																																		
"Note that the iron grade was determined by NRRI by the wet chemical iron titration method, which"																																		
is used for commercial trading of iron ore pellets and is more precise than the XRF determination																																		
"after lithium metaborate fusion, as employed by ALS. For all other elements, the method of analysis"																																		
was comparable.

"Further development of the furnace firing cycle, utilizing the mineralogy and chemistry, could be"																																		
used to further optimize and enhance blast furnace pellet quality. Although Met-Chem previously																																		
"undertook bench-scale metallurgical testing (on behalf of Rio Tinto), it was limited to mini pot"

representative pilot-scale pellets from Pampa de Pongo iron concentrate. The resulting pellet quality																																		
is very good and there remains room for optimization.																																		
NRRI commented that “preheat cycle time would have been modified and significantly higher pellet

would have improved LTD (81.3% +6.3mm) that is known to be impacted by preheat ramp and																																		
"production rate. Further development of the furnace firing cycle, utilizing the mineralogy and"

"(reduction) from iron oxide material, in solid state (without melting). Reduction is achieved when a"																																		
reducing gas (typically hydrogen and carbon monoxide) is passed through the iron oxide feed																																		
material at a temperature between 760° and 970°C. Direct Reduction Iron is commonly used in an																																		
"Electric Arc Furnace (EAF) to produce steel, instead of, or in combination with, scrap iron. The DRI"																																		
"process requires specific physical and chemical quality feedstock, which must remain consistent as a"																																		
product. Only a small percentage of pellets produced globally can meet the stringent requirements.																																		
"15.4.1	Material Evaluation Test Results"																																		
MIDREX® Technologies Inc. determined the suitability of the Pampa de Pongo pellets (as produced																																		
"at NRRI) as Direct Reduction (DR) process feed, through industry standard Linder and Hot Load"																																		
Tests.																																		
Linder Test																																		
The purpose of the Linder Test is to determine the iron oxide pellet’s susceptibility to generate																																		
unwanted fines during the reduction step accompanied by bed movement in the shaft furnace.																																		
Potential for fines generation is due to furnace rotation (simulating bed movement in the shaft																																		
furnace) and carburization of the iron oxide material during reduction (which can contribute to fines																																		
generation). Fines are defined as less than 3.36 mm material (6 mesh).

Metallization and fragmentation exceeded typical DRI product. Compression was lower than

values are not indicative of a commercially-made pellet”.																																		
Hot Load Test																																		
The Hot Load Test simulates the increasing load experienced by the pellets as they descend through																																		
a shaft furnace. The test focuses on the physical durability of the pellet during reduction. Both																																		
uncoated and lime-coated pellets were tested and both performed well. Metallization was																																		
approximately 99%. The DRI product demonstrated reasonable strength as is typical for pilot-scale																																		
"pellets. Critically, clustering did not occur with either uncoated (816°C) or coated (927°C) pellets,"																																		
which is extremely positive.

Fluxed DR Pellets																																		
Fluxed DR-grade iron oxide pellets are made by adding magnesium and/or calcium (flux) in the form																																		
of limestone and dolomite to the pelletizing feed mix. Elevated magnesium oxide (MgO) in pellets is																																		
desirable to the steelmaker as it means less flux addition to the Electric Arc Furnace. Pellet producers																																		
are forced to pay extra for dolomite or limestone to produce fluxed pellets; therefore fluxed (basic)																																		
"pellets are more costly to produce than standard (acid) pellets. On the other hand, the high MgO"																																		
content in the Pampa de Pongo pellets may be viewed as leverage in price negotiations because the																																		
"total iron content is lower than that of the highest quality DR grade pellets; therefore, a slight cost"																																		
penalty may result. The Pampa de Pongo pellets contain elevated magnesium and are therefore																																		
saleable as self-fluxing DR grade pellets. Note that lime-addition to the pellet feed as flux should not																																		
"be confused with lime-coating, the latter of which purely mitigates clustering of DRI product at high"																																		
temperature.																																		
Silica Content																																		
"Silica content of DRI should be as low as possible for steel-makers using an Electric Arc Furnace,"																																		
"preferably less than 2.0%. The Pampa de Pongo iron oxide pellets will meet this requirement, but"																																		
further optimization of the processing can lower silica even further. Laboratory scale liberation																																		
grinding tests at NRRI have indicated that a concentrate can be produced with high-grade iron																																		
content (66.87% - 68.54%) and low silica content (0.18% - 0.57%) with a small amount of additional																																		
grinding. Low silica and the presence of MgO contribute to the zero-clustering observed in the Hot																																		
Load test undertaken at MIDREX®.																																		
"15.4.3	Detailed Results"																																		
The iron ore pellet sample sent from NRRI to MIDREX® was the product produced from three																																		
batches of full pot-grate pellets. MIDREX® conducted elemental analyses in triplicate. Sulphur and																																		
"carbon are determined by LECO, while iron grade was determined by wet chemical titration, and"																																		
remaining elements are determined by ICP.																																		
Analysis and test results from the MIDREX® Material Evaluation are presented in detail

"15.4.4	Summary"																																		
"In its report, MIDREX® indicated that “The Cardero Pampa de Pongo DR pellets performed well in"																																		
standard Midrex tests. Chemical and physical characteristics were comparable to commercially																																		
"produced pellets that have been used successfully in the Midrex DR Process®. Based on these results,"																																		
it is expected that commercially produced pellets made from this ore would be a suitable feedstock																																		
for the Midrex DR Process®”.																																		
Maximum MIDREX® DR plant productivity is achieved by operating the shaft furnace with inlet gas																																		
temperatures ranging from 760-970°C (or higher). Lime coating of DR pellets is required when																																		
"operating under higher temperature conditions, mitigating burden sticking and clustering. The results"																																		
posted from the 927°C hot load test prove that the lime coated Pampa de Pongo pellets are a																																		
satisfactory feed material for a Midrex DR plant operating under the most severe conditions.																																		
"15.4.5	Future Work"																																		
Future work for DR grade pellets should be oriented at optimizing pellet quality. Areas where Pampa																																		
de Pongo pellet quality may be improved are:																																		
1. Reducing the pellet silica content is a high value quality improvement step. This can be																																		
accomplished by grinding the ore a little finer so as to target 0.34% silica content in the																																		
"concentrate. Assuming that 0.66% bentonite addition is the binder, the resultant pellet silica"																																		
"content would fall from 2.14 to 0.67%, and hence the total iron content would increase from"

64.16 to about 65.1%. Such an increase in pellet total iron content would be very well received																																		
by DR plant operators.																																		
"2.	Another method to further decrease the silica content could involve substituting the bentonite"																																		
binder with an organic binder such as peridur. Additional grinding may also be employed with																																		
the use of peridur so as to further decrease the pellet silica content.																																		
"3.	Additional hot load testing of the Pampa de Pongo pellets at 927-980oC without the use of lime"																																		
coating should be tested. The threshold temperature for clustering or sticking has yet to be																																		
"determined, and if the Pampa de Pongo pellets can be processed in the hot load testing apparatus"																																		
"at these temperatures without lime coating, then this implies some cost savings."																																		
"4.	DRI which possesses high carbon content is in high demand, and the maximum carbon content"																																		
for the Pampa de Pongo pellets has not been determined. Pellets produced from a finer grind																																		
concentrate for the purpose of decreasing the silica content may behave differently during																																		
carburization in the Linder test. The effect of concentrate grind size on carburization of the DRI																																		
product should be determined.

"16	Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve"																																		
Estimates																																		
"16.1	Introduction"																																		
The primary objective of SRK’s work on the Pampa de Pongo’s deposit was to produce an																																		
"independent, CIM compliant resource estimate for the deposit. This estimate supersedes a 2005"																																		
"estimate for the deposit, produced by J.N. Helsen."																																		
The SRK estimate was conducted on a dataset that combines both historical Rio Tinto data collected																																		
in the 1994-96 program and Cardero data collected in the 2004-05 drillhole program.																																		
The principal components of SRK’s estimation work included:																																		
"•	Interpretation of the 3D magnetic inversion model;"																																		
"•	Defining geological domains;"																																		
"•	Construction of a 3D geological model in Datamine to constrain the data selection and"																																		
interpolation processes;																																		
"•	Iron, gold, copper, mineral resource estimation by inverse squared distance methodology; and"																																		
"•	Resource classification."																																		
"16.2	Geological Model"																																		
"Four magnetite rich zones have been located within the Pampa de Pongo property: Central, East and"																																		
two South Zones. Only the Central and two South Zones were solid modeled for resource estimation																																		
purposes. A range of tonnes and grade were estimated for the East Zone however due to the lack of																																		
drill density these were classified as conceptual.																																		
The boundaries of the higher grade mineralization in the Central and South Zones were defined by																																		
relatively sharp drop offs in grade in both the hanging wall and footwall contacts. This hard																																		
boundary is roughly represented by a 20% Fe grade which drops to a 5-8% grade in the adjacent																																		
hanging wall and footwall as the intensity of replacement textures dramatically decreases. Within the																																		
mineralized zones a very continuous interval of >40% Fe grade was encountered. The main																																		
exception to the trend of a sharp drop off was the hanging wall of the Central Zone. In this area an																																		
area of highly mixed intervals of >5% Fe and <40% Fe overlies a >40% Fe interval of higher grade.																																		
A 20% Fe boundary was used to define solid boundaries for all zones in the solid modeling. A																																		
separate surface was created to separate the Central Zone high grade (>40% Fe) from the overlying																																		
mixed grade zone whose average grade met at least a 20% Fe threshold. SRK found this approach to																																		
solid modeling appropriate as the two areas were geologically distinct in that the overlying mixed																																		
"grade zone contained a higher proportion of ocoite sills, and breccia zones as well as partial"

replacement textures. The underlying high grade zone was dominantly represented by massive																																		
magnetite replacement zones.																																		
Quantec Geoscience Peru SA generated 3D magnetic models from ground magnetic surveys																																		
completed in 2008. This magnetic data was compared to vertical drillhole intercepts. A 0.6 SI																																		
susceptibility level correlated well with the drop off in Fe grades and was used to define the lateral																																		
extent of the Central Zone solids. Because the South Zone mineralization is considerably thinner																																		
"than the Central Zone, a 0.45 SI susceptibility level was used to define the lateral extent of the South"																																		
Zone solids. Figure 16.1 highlights the 0.6 SI magnetic susceptibility contour for the Central Zone																																		
located to the north and the East Zone located to the southeast.

grades are reasonably well correlated in the Central and South Zone by drilling and were used to																																		
estimate the conceptual tonnes and grade range for the East Zone.																																		
"In the East Zone, in order to reflect the relative magnetic intensity to the high grade iron formation"																																		
"thickness, a 0.5 SI susceptibility contour was used to delimit the extents in plan along with"																																		
approximately half the vertical thickness of the Central Zone to reflect the relative decrease in																																		
magnetic response between the two anomalies. The vertical thickness of the anomaly was adjusted																																		
by 50 m within the 0.5 SI susceptibility contour to generate two solids representing a minimum and																																		
maximum range of volume. This was then multiplied by the average density for mineralized iron																																		
formation. A range of conceptual grade was generated by averaging the two high grade intervals in																																		
drillhole PPD004 for an approximation of the higher grade limit and averaging both high grade																																		
intervals with the intervening low grade interval for an approximation of the lower grade range. The																																		
conceptual tonnes and grade are estimated to range between 350-500 million tonnes while the grade																																		
for the tonnage is estimated to range between 32% and 38% Fe.

"The bulk density (termed SG in the report) database is comprised of a set of 210 determinations,"																																		
measured on-site by Cardero personnel. A small subset of 23 samples from the waste hanging wall																																		
was used to assign density value of 2.7 t/m3 to blocks outside of the mineralized domains.																																		
There is high correlation between the Fe assay values and the SG data (see Figure 16.6). A formula

"16.5	Estimation Methodology"																																		
In order to appropriately weight the Fe grades by SG to account for the impact of density on Fe																																		
"grade, SG values were used to interpolate Fe grades. Both the accumulation (SG x Fe %) and the SG"																																		
were estimated by the inverse distance squared interpolation. The final block Fe estimates represent																																		
the ratio of accumulation and SG estimated values within each block. Au and Cu block grades were																																		
also estimated using inverse distance squared interpolation.																																		
"16.6	Block Models"																																		
The block model comprises blocks measuring 25 m x 25 m x 10 m in size aligned north-south and																																		
east-west. The basic block model geometry is summarised in Table 16.4.

Table 16.5 shows the estimation parameters used for estimating the blocks in all zones. The																																		
"Datamine dynamic search routine was used for estimating the blocks in three passes. In the first pass,"																																		
the blocks were estimated within a relatively small 400 m isotropic search ellipse. Progressively																																		
larger search ellipses were used to estimate grade in subsequent passes until all blocks in the																																		
interpreted solid were filled. A hard boundary was used to divide the grade interpolation for the																																		
lower grade C1UP and for the C1DWN portions of the Central Zone.

"16.8	Block Model Validation"																																		
The following validation exercises were carried out on the block model:																																		
"•	Comparison of local “well-informed” block accumulation and SG estimates with composites"																																		
contained within those blocks.																																		
"•	Comparison of average drillhole accumulation and SG values with average block estimates along"																																		
different directions - swath plots																																		
"16.8.1	Comparison of Block Estimates with Composites"																																		
Figure 16.8 shows how the “well-informed” block estimated accumulation (FeSG) and block																																		
estimated SG compare with drillhole composites contained within those blocks. Each estimated																																		
block accumulation and SG were compared separately with drillhole average composite																																		
"accumulation and SG within the block. Overall, average accumulation and SG values are almost"																																		
"identical and the correlation is very high. This is not surprising, considering large drillhole spacing"																																		
and in turn large influence of drillhole assays on blocks intersected by the drillholes. The thick white																																		
line that runs through the middle of the cloud is the result of a piece-wise linear regression smoother.

"16.10	Mineral Resource Classification"																																		
The mineral resource for the Pampa de Pongo deposit has been classified entirely as inferred. The																																		
following factors contributed to the classification of the current resource estimate																																		
"•	Although assay data was largely validated by the QAQC analysis, much of the Rio Tinto"																																		
deleterious assay database was found to be suspect and therefore not included in the resource																																		
estimate resulting in a lack of data to fully characterize potential economic quality;																																		
"•	Drillhole spacing of 250-500m;"																																		
"•	Lateral extends of the zones are defined from “soft” geophysical data."																																		
"•	The classification of resources is based on the interpreted continuity of Fe grades only. The"																																		
understanding of the geological controls on Au and Cu grade distribution are far less understood																																		
and therefore less confidence should be assigned to these grades.

"16.11	Mineral Resource Statement"																																		
The mineral resources were estimated by Ebi Ghayem (P.Geo.) and reviewed by Marek Nowak																																		
(P.Eng.) and George Wahl (P.Geo.) who are all Qualified Persons. The effective date of the Mineral																																		
"Resource Statement is September 30th, 2008. The mineral resources are not mineral reserves and do"																																		
"not have demonstrated economic viability. SRK is not aware of any environmental, permitting, legal,"																																		
"title, taxation, socio-political, marketing or other relevant issues that may affect the mineral resource"																																		
estimate.																																		
The classified inferred mineral resource estimates at 15% Fe cut-off grade are tabulated in																																		
Table 16.7. The resources represent all estimated blocks within the modeled zones. The economic																																		
cut-off used to generate mineral resources was assumed and based on experience with similar																																		
projects. The final cut-off required to produce a saleable product will need to be confirmed by future																																		
metallurgical testwork. This economic cut-off was applied to both the Central and South Zones.																																		
"Although the South Zones contribute a relatively small tonnage, SRK is of the opinion that there are"																																		
reasonable prospects for additional tonnage in this area which would then make these resources																																		
amenable to underground mining methods.

"16.12	Comparison with Previous Resource Estimates"																																		
Helsen (2005) estimated a total inferred mineral resource of 953 million tonnes at 44.7% Fe. This																																		
estimate was based on same drillhole dataset as the SRK resource estimate. A comparison between																																		
the current SRK and Helsen estimates is included in Table 16.8 and 16.9.																																		
The main difference in tonnage between the two estimates results from the interpretation of the																																		
lateral extent of the 3D magnetic inversion data. SRK’s estimate was based on a 2008 magnetic																																		
survey and a recent interpretation completed by Quantec Geophysics while Helsen’s was based on																																		
2004 magnetic data covering a much smaller survey area. . The end result was that the Helsen																																		
interpretation produced a much larger lateral surface area and resulting volume. Quantec Geophysics																																		
investigated this difference and concluded that it was possible to validate both the 2004 surface area																																		
used by Helsen and the 2008 surface area used for SRK’s resource estimate based on the magnetic																																		
database available for each estimate. As the 2008 magnetic data covers a larger area in more detail																																		
the SRK resource estimate is considered more reliable.																																		
"In addition, Helsen adopted an average thickness based on drill hole intercepts and multiplied this"																																		
average thickness by the estimated surface area resulting in a volume represented by a vertical																																		
cylinder. The average thickness estimated by Helsen was biased by the drill hole intercepts which																																		
were targeted towards the core of mineralization and thickest portion of the 3D magnetic anomaly.																																		
SRK’s volume reflected the gradual tapering of the magnetic anomaly downwards around the																																		
periphery of the mineralization as suggested by the 3D magnetic inversion as well as the two drill																																		
holes intersecting the outer limits of the mineralization (drill holes RTDDH-2 and RTDDH-3). The																																		
3D dome-shaped solid used by SRK to estimate resources compared to Helsen’s cylindrical shape as																																		
well as differences in the interpreted lateral extent of mineralization explains a significant portion of																																		
the volume and tonnage differences between the two estimates.																																		
Differences in estimated grade in both the Central and South Zones indicate that the SRK estimate																																		
also adopted a lower Fe grade to define the solid boundaries used to define composites for resource																																		
estimation. As a result a larger number of lower grade intervals were included in the SRK estimate.

Table 16.9 indicates that the magnetic inversion interpretation generated an approximately similar																																		
"tonnage for the South Zone. With the SRK estimate, the South Zone tonnage is slightly larger and"																																		
the grade was lower as a result of a lower cut off used to define the solid than was used by Helsen.																																		
"In both the Helsen and SRK estimates, the lack of low grade above the higher grade mineralization,"																																		
"the relatively narrow thickness of mineralization and the proximity of the mineralization to surface,"																																		
all contributed to a much more consistent interpretation of the lateral extent and volume of the																																		
"mineralization. In SRK’s opinion, the Helsen resource estimate reasonably reflects the 2004"

Geotechnical Evaluation																																		
A preliminary geotechnical evaluation was conducted to assess and characterize the rock mass of the																																		
Central and South Zones for open pit and underground mining development options. Based on this																																		
"evaluation, input recommendations for mining method selection and potential mine design"																																		
parameters have been provided.																																		
This evaluation is based on a limited number of exploration holes that have been drilled at the site by																																		
"both Rio Tinto and Cardero. Of the 28 drillholes completed at the Pampa de Pongo project, the"																																		
Central Zone and South Zones each have five holes that intersect the inferred resource.																																		
Information used for the geotechnical evaluation included:																																		
"•	Drillhole logs for Rio Tinto and Cardero. Cardero drillholes which included RQD and recovery"																																		
"data, and collar co-ordinates. RQD values were not available for Rio Tinto drillholes;"																																		
"•	Core photographs for all Cardero and Rio Tinto (split core only) drillholes;"																																		
"•	The June 2008 structural report completed by SRK Consulting entitled “Evaluation of the"																																		
"Structural Geology of the Pampa de Pongo Fe Project, Peru.” See Appendix C."																																		
"The geotechnical evaluation included a review of representative cores in the Lima core yard,"																																		
followed by a comprehensive review of the drillhole photographs of all the available drillholes in the																																		
"zones of interest. Rock Mass Rating (“RMR”, Laubscher 1990) geotechnical parameters were"																																		
"estimated for all the sections of the cores. From this assessment, broad geotechnical domains were"																																		
determined and a representative range of RMR’s estimated for each of the domains.																																		
A summary of the geotechnical evaluation is presented in this section. The detailed geotechnical																																		
descriptions and results of the rockmass evaluation are presented in Appendix A. All geotechnical																																		
descriptions have been interpreted from limited drillhole intersections of the mineralized zones and																																		
surrounding rockmass at the Pampa de Pongo project.																																		
Geotechnical Domains																																		
The geotechnical domains at the Pampa de Pongo project can be separated into four basic units:																																		
"Overburden, massive mineralization, semi-massive mineralization, and country rock."

The mineralization in the Central Zone consists of massive style mineralization beneath semi-																																		
massive style mineralization. In general the massive mineralization is of fair rock mass quality																																		
(RMR values estimated between 45 and 55) while the semi-massive is considered to be of poor to																																		
fair rock mass condition (RMR 30 - 45).

Partial extraction mining methods could be considered in the South Zones. Cave mining methods are																																		
"not considered feasible due to the irregular mineralization geometry, weak overburden materials,"																																		
"poor quality country rock mass, and the limited stoping dimensions achievable within the weak"																																		
mineralization.																																		
"Based on the geotechnical review, an open pit scenario could also be considered for the South Zone"																																		
(S2). The overburden pit wall slope for a potential South Zone pit would have to be at a very shallow																																		
"angle (26o) due to conglomerate cementation that is predominantly weak, as seen as large zones of"																																		
loose sand in drill core. Additional holes in the overburden may be able to further define the																																		
"overburden characteristics and strength variability. In this situation, the following slope angles"																																		
presented in Table 18.3 are recommended.

Hydrogeology																																		
No information was available on hydrogeology for the Central or South Zones and it was assumed																																		
that any potential water inflow into the mines could be managed without excessive cost. The Pampa																																		
de Pongo project is located in a desert with extremely low precipitation and will not likely be																																		
influenced at all from precipitation. The existence and nature of any aquifers in the potential mining																																		
areas must be investigated if the project is to continue.

The grade distribution in the Central Zone appears to show an increase in grade with depth to the																																		
basal extent of the mineralized zone. Grades in the lower part of the Central Zone average about 46%																																		
Fe while grades in the upper part are in the 27% Fe range. Table 18.13 shows a distribution of grades																																		
in the upper (C1UP) and lower (C1DWN) of the Central Zone.

"“Although data quality from Pampa de Pongo is relatively good, the data is sparse because of the"																																		
"current stage of exploration and lack of outcrop. Therefore, structural interpretations are tentative"																																		
and likely to change with further drilling.																																		
Fe-mineralization is hosted by the regional-scale NNW-trending Hucca fault system. In the vicinity																																		
of Pampa de Pongo ENE-trending faults affiliated to the Repiticion Group of Hawkes et al (2002)																																		
"intersect this structure. In addition, a WNW-trending structural fabric is observed on magnetic"																																		
survey maps (Analytic Signal). The deposit is therefore expected to be affected by brittle fault																																		
"structures, including some significant fault zones."																																		
Photographs of drillcore preserve evidence of significant numbers of brittle structures in the Pampa																																		
de Pongo area. The cores are affected by numerous broken and gougey zones associated with																																		
moderate to steeply-dipping slip surfaces. It has not been possible to validate the precise nature and																																		
style offaulting which have been reported elsewhere in the Marcona District.”																																		
Further definition of the fault structures in the Pampa de Pongo area will be crucial for future mine																																		
"development. The effect of structures on the possibility of mining has not been considered, as at this"																																		
stage a caving direction has not been selected.																																		
"18.1.2	Mining Method Selection"																																		
The context of the Central Zone deposit did not make it readily apparent whether an open pit or																																		
"underground mining method would provide the best economic outcome for the project. It was,"																																		
"therefore, decided to conduct a Whittle™ Optimization analysis to determine the potentially best"																																		
approach based on preliminary parameters. The parameters selected for this early-stage study are																																		
shown in Table 18.4.

Open Pit Analysis																																		
The Whittle™ OP/UG cross-over study indicted the underground option for the Central Zones would																																		
yield better economic returns than the open pit scenario. This conclusion was based on the early																																		
"assumption that the underground mining method would likely be a bulk mining method and, as such,"																																		
an underground unit operating mining costs of $5.00/tonne was used. The verification of the																																		
suitability of a bulk mining (caving) method was later confirmed.																																		
"The study found that the Central deposit, with 300+ m of overlying waste was too deep and required"																																		
"too much pre-stripping to be economic. The Whittle™ optimization analysis did, in fact, generate an"																																		
"open pit shell, however, when a preliminary mining schedule was applied to the shell it became clear"																																		
"that the open pit option would not be economic. It must be noted, however, that the open pit scenario"																																		
was investigated using zero grade material above the main Central Zone mineralized domain. If																																		
"further drilling is done on the deposit the lower-grade, semi-massive mineralization above the main"																																		
Central Zone should be estimated and an open pit re-evaluated.																																		
Two other significant factors came into play in the Central Zone open pit analysis. As previously																																		
"stated, Fe grade in the Central Zone increases with depth, so an open pit would only reach the higher"																																		
"grade material later in the mine life. Additionally, once it was determined that the central Zone had"																																		
"the potential to be mine with a low-cost block or panel cave method, the open pit option was"																																		
eliminated as an option in this study.																																		
Underground Method Selection																																		
"After compiling the available deposit context information, a review of underground mining methods"																																		
was undertaken. The first and generally most desirable method investigated was a massive mining																																		
"method. Block caving is generally the lowest cost, highest production bulk underground mining"																																		
method and is appropriate for large deposits with consistent grades like Pampa de Pongo’s Central																																		
Zone. Caving operations have proven very successful in base metal mines in South America. The																																		
"large physical footprint and vertical extent of the Central Zone, coupled with favourable preliminary"																																		
ground conditions made the caving option the method of choice.																																		
Caving Methology																																		
Block Caving and Panel Caving are mining methods which do not use drilling and blasting to																																		
"fracture production rock, but rather rely on an initial unsupported spans to fail and create broken"																																		
"rock, which flows by gravity to an extraction location, a drawpoint. This is achieved by opening up a"																																		
large enough area beneath the mineralization to become geotechnically unstable and fail. Broken																																		
material in the cave is drawn out though openings beneath the undercut level (the start of the cave).																																		
"As material is drawn from the cave, a void is opened and more material fails from the unstable span"																																		
to fill the void. See Figure 18.3 for a theoretical section view of how a cave works.																																		
"As mineralized material is drawn out of the cave zone, the cave will continue to expand until"																																		
eventually waste rock outside of the mineralized zone will get mixed with the mineralized rock and

create dilution. The pulling of muck from a drawpoint will continue until the rock becomes diluted to																																		
a point of not being economic (the cut-off grade). When this happens the drawpoint will be closed

Footprint Finder Analyses																																		
Gemcom’s PCBC (Personal Computer Block Cave) Footprint Finder software was used to determine																																		
the most economic cave footprints or aerial extent for the Central Zone cave. The software works by																																		
splitting the deposit into individual columns and calculating the maximum economic value of each																																		
column based on the input parameters (see Table 18.5). The cave footprint is compiled by grouping																																		
regions of columns with positive economic values.

Caving Blocks																																		
"The shape of the base of the Central Zone deposit prevents a single, flat footprint from caving the"																																		
entire deposit. With a single footprint significant quantities of waste would have to be mined from																																		
"the south end of the deposit, or significant quantities of the mineralized zone would need to be left"																																		
behind on the north end of the deposit. (See Figure 18.4)																																		
Figure 18.4: Central Zone Section View Showing a Single Mining Block with Excluded																																		
Mineralization and Excess Waste																																		
The deposit was analyzed in multiple parts to maximize the deposit recovery and prevent waste from																																		
being initially mined. Figure 18.5 presents the two mining blocks determined by this analysis. Block																																		
1 was determined to be the largest economic footprint developed entirely in mineralized material at a																																		
single elevation. This initial block was designed to provide the quickest economic payback and

encompasses the highest grade material and the greatest vertical cave height. The higher grade boosts																																		
initial revenue and the high cave height minimizes initial development costs.																																		
Figure 18.5: Central Zone Section View Outlining Two Cave																																		
Blocks																																		
The shape of Block 2 was determined to be the most economic footprint of the remaining																																		
"mineralization. Block 2 was set back 70° from the base of Block 1, to accommodate geotechnical"																																		
instability as a result of caving activities below. A pillar between the Blocks 1 and 2 was taken back																																		
"at an angle of 70o and was excluded from the mining plan, as it will not likely be recovered by the"																																		
mining of either block.																																		
LOM Tonnes and Grade																																		
Footprint Finder was used to calculate the insitu tonnages and grades of mineralized material in each																																		
cave block. The height of each column in each block was stopped at the point where external dilution																																		
(material not in the mineralized zone model) is first introduced to the column. An additional 10%																																		
was added to the total tonnes mined to account for dilution. This corresponded with an assumed																																		
grade factor of 90% over the life of the mine. Total diluted tonnes and grades of each block are listed																																		
in Table 18.6 and do not include mineralized development muck.

Production Rate																																		
"Using a vertical cave advance rate of 100 mm per day, a drawpoint area of 250 m2 per drawpoint and"																																		
"average cave heights for each block, maximum production rates were estimated. These factors were"																																		
determined based on SRK experience with other caving projects. Although 100 mm per day has been																																		
"used for the entire life of the mine, cave advance rates of 200-250mm per day may be achievable"																																		
once a drawpoint has been open for some time. Based on the draw rate and the number of drawpoints																																		
"available for extraction a mining rate of 75,000 tpd was selected. This rate provides a 24 year mine"																																		
"life, using approximately 800 drawpoints to meet full production."																																		
"Based on experience, it was assumed that production in Block 1 would take five years to ramp up to"																																		
"its steady target rate of 75,000 tpd. For this study, the ramp-up rate was assumed to be linear,"																																		
although the actual rate of production in the initial years will start off slow and increase as the																																		
development of the undercut progresses.																																		
Caving Methods																																		
"At 250m2 per drawpoint, Block 1 will have a total of 1740 drawpoints and Block 2 will have a total"																																		
of 844 drawpoints.																																		
"Block 1 will be mined as a panel cave, since production targets can be met without having to open all"																																		
the drawpoints ate one time. There will be opportunity to distribute the capital cost of and undercut																																		
development and drawpoint construction over the life the mine with a panel cave method.																																		
Block 2 will be mined as a block cave since the majority of drawpoints must be open in order to																																		
meet production targets. All undercut development and drawpoint construction must be completed																																		
by the time that Block 2 reaches full production.																																		
Dilution																																		
It is typical of a caving operation to keep pulling from a drawpoint until the material is no longer																																		
economic - it falls below the cut-off grade. Depending in the grade of the mineralization this may																																		
support a high factor of dilution. For this study grade factors were explicitly defined. It was assumed																																		
that the mine would have a Grade Factor of 95% (95% of the value of insitu grade will reach the																																		
mill) for the first 3 years of mine life. A Grade Factor of 90% has been assumed for the remaining																																		
years of mine life. The higher grade factor in the initial 3 years of cave development was based on																																		
"the assumption that, while growing, the cave would not reach sufficient height to encounter"																																		
"excessive external dilution. It also assumed that the mineralized development muck, about 3% of"																																		
"total LOM mill feed, would have no dilution."																																		
The grade factor was held constant for the year 4 and beyond and assumed that all high dilution																																		
mineralization encountered will be offset by low dilution mineralization from newer drawpoints.

Cut-off Grade																																		
"Because grade factor was explicitly defined, a cut off grade was not used in the Footprint Finder"																																		
mining simulation. Mining of a column was cut off as soon as any dilution external to the C1UP and																																		
C1DWN regions defined in block model was encountered.																																		
"18.1.4	Mine Development Design"																																		
"Upon obtaining the basic caving block shapes from Footprint Finder, mine development planning"																																		
commenced using Mine 2-4D mine planning and scheduling software. All capital development was																																		
"planned in 3D to determine development types, lengths and quantities as well as infrastructure"																																		
"required to support a 75,000 tpd Central Zone mine."

zone. Figures 18.8 and 18.9 show the mine development in plan and isometric view respectively.

"Individual vent raises between extraction level cross cuts and exhaust drifts were not modeled, but"																																		
their cumulative development length was estimated and added to the development schedule.																																		
Ventilation Development																																		
Construction Ventilation																																		
Auxiliary vent fans and tubing will be used to ventilate the main and conveyor declines while they																																		
are under construction. When both declines are complete (access and conveyor) they will provide a																																		
loop to supply all ventilation to the mine until vent shafts to the surface are completed with fresh air																																		
traveling down the access ramp and return air traveling up the conveyor decline.																																		
Auxiliary vent fans will be used to provide adequate air to dead end working faces during all																																		
development activity. During construction there will be a maximum of 30 active faces at one time.																																		
Production Ventilation																																		
"Once the ventilation shafts to surface are completed, fresh air will be taken in though the three 8.5 m"																																		
diameter intake vent shafts on the west side of the mine and exhausted through three matching																																		
exhaust vent shafts on the east side of the mine. Each intake and exhaust shaft will have fans on																																		
surface forcing air down it or drawing air up it respectively.																																		
"On the haulage levels, fresh air will pass through the length of all primary tunnels from west to east."																																		
"On the extraction level, fresh air will enter the west end, travel through the ring drifts around each"																																		
"side of the mineralized zone, through both ends of each cross cut, and down central vent raises to the"																																		
exhaust level. (See Figure 18.10) Air to the undercut will be boosted and distributed to the crosscuts																																		
with auxiliary fans.																																		
"In all sections of the mine, ventilation doors, bulkheads and regulators will be maintained and"																																		
adjusted to optimize the efficiency of the ventilation system.

De-watering Development																																		
Development for a pumping level is included at the base of the main ramp. This development will																																		
"contain sumps to collect water, facilities to settle solid particles out of the water and a permanent"																																		
pumping station to transport the water to surface. No de-watering development was planned other																																		
than sump and pump station excavations.																																		
Extraction Development																																		
Construction Haulage																																		
Initial mineralized development rock and development waste rock will be loaded onto haul trucks																																		
and transported out of the mine through the main decline. Once the conveyor is commissioned there																																		
will be opportunity to use excess convey capacity to transport development waste to surface.																																		
Provisions will be made on surface to redirect waste to a separate stockpile on surface.																																		
Production Haulage																																		
Perimeter haulage excavations were designed around the Blocks 1 and 2. ROM rock will be																																		
transported from the drawpoints to orepasses on the extraction level by LHDs. Trucks will haul the																																		
rock from the orepasses to one of two crushing stations located at each end of the deposit. The																																		
crushers will feed the primary conveyor to surface where the ROM rock will be stockpiled for																																		
processing. The stockpile will have a reclaim system that transports ROM rock from the stockpile to																																		
the mill as required.

Undercut Development and Drawpoint Construction																																		
"Block 1 will be a panel cave, requiring the caving panels to advance at a rate that will allow the mine"																																		
to maintain full production. The undercut level will expand and new extraction drawpoints																																		
"constructed at the required rate of panel advance. Block 2 will be a block cave, requiring the entire"																																		
undercut to be developed and all of the drawpoints to be constructed before full production can be																																		
achieved. The total undercut areas and drawpoint requirements over the life of the mine are listed in																																		
"Table 18.12. At a 75,000 tpd production rate, and a draw of 93 tonnes/drawpoint/day, approximately"																																		
800 drawpoints are required to be in production at any given time.																																		
"18.1.5	Mobile Equipment"																																		
Mining activities will be conducted with conventional underground mobile mining equipment. LHDs																																		
will be used for the transportation of muck from drawpoints to orepasses and trucks will be used to																																		
transport muck from orepasses to the crushers. Development and construction equipment was																																		
assumed to be done conventional diesel-powered underground equipment with electric-hydraulic																																		
"jumbos, longhole rigs, rockbolters and other ancillary equipment. The equipment fleet estimated for"																																		
this study is listed in Table 18.8.																																		
Production Fleet Selection																																		
"To meet the production requirements of this study, 21-tonne capacity LHDs and 80-tonne haul trucks"																																		
were selected. LHDs and haul trucks were assumed to be operating an average of 14 hours per day																																		
each. The approximate productivity of one unit was determined by applying the maximum haulage																																		
distance required of the unit to the productivity curves provided by the equipment manufacturer. This																																		
productivity was further reduced by 1/3 to reflect realistic working conditions.																																		
Quantities of each machine were by dividing the required daily production by the calculated																																		
productivity of one unit and adding 15% for spare units.																																		
Production Support Equipment																																		
A rock breaker will be required at each active orepass to ensure that large material is broken to pass																																		
through orepass grizzlies. It has been assumed that as the caving panels advance in Block 1 not all 24																																		
orepasses will be active at one time but that all 18 ore-passes will be active at all times in Block 2.																																		
Drawpoint hang-ups due to oversized rock will be drilled and blasted to free up the drawpoint. One																																		
hang-up drill per six production LHDs was assumed.

Support Equipment																																		
Support equipment was selected to service underground development and production operations. The																																		
quantities of transport and maintenance equipment were factored from the total equipment in the																																		
mine.																																		
Crushers																																		
"Two underground crushers, each capable of crushing the full mine production rate to a 0.3 m"																																		
nominal size were selected. The two crushers will feed a central single conveyor. Crushers were																																		
planned at either end of the haulage level to reduce the maximum haulage distance.																																		
Conveyors																																		
Conveyors were selected for the transport of rock to surface project due to their low operating costs																																		
"per tonne of rock, the flexibility, and the speed at which a conveyor decline can be constructed from"																																		
the exploration access decline.																																		
Three methods were briefly considered in this study for transporting material out of the mine.																																		
"•	Haul Trucks"																																		
"•	Hoisting up a shaft with skips."																																		
"•	Conveyors"																																		
Due to the depth of this mine the distance that trucks would have to haul to surface makes the																																		
haulage cost per tonne far greater than with shafts or conveyors. The quantity of trucks that would be																																		
"required to move 75,000 tpd makes truck haulage impractical due to development and ventilation"																																		
requirements and the number of haulage ramps required.																																		
"It was estimated that at least two production shafts would be required to transport 75,000 tpd of"																																		
material out of the mine plus a men and materials shaft. It was estimated that a single conveyor																																		
decline could be used to transport the full mine production coupled with an access decline for men																																		
and materials. It was envisioned that the construction of a conveyor decline would be stared from																																		
multiple points along the length of the main decline. This will allow the conveyor decline to be																																		
constructed in less time than the shafts that would be required for this mine.

Table 18.100. The schedule is based on early access to the Central Zone deposit with an exploration																																		
"decline, that will initially allow for sampling and testing of the mineralized zone, and that will later"																																		
serve at the principle access to the mine. All subsequent development in the mine will start from the																																		
exploration decline.																																		
"Critical Milestones in the development plan are at Years 1, 5 and 18 and are outlined below."																																		
Year 1 - Primary development and infrastructure required for initial production:																																		
"•	Sufficient Block 1 undercut, extraction, and haulage level development to support initial"																																		
production of 4.3 Mt.																																		
"•	Block 1 undercut opened to 38,000 m2 to support initial production."																																		
"•	271 Block 1 drawpoints constructed to support initial production."																																		
"•	Conveyor decline completed to transport first production mill feed rock."																																		
"•	One crusher online."																																		
"•	One Intake Vent Shaft, one Exhaust Vent Shaft, and 4 vent drifts to provide adequate air to"																																		
support production equipment																																		
Year 5 - Primary development and infrastructure required for full production																																		
"•	Block 1 extraction and haulage levels completed."

Mining Block Sequence																																		
Block 1 will be mined first because of its larger size and greater potential return on capital. To																																		
"maximize initial return, the first panels of Block 1 will begin in the central southern area of the"																																		
undercut. This is where the highest columns and grades will be mined. Two panels will continue out																																		
"from this point, one progressing to the north-west and the other to the north-east."																																		
Construction and ramp-up production from of Block 2 will take place during the final years of Block																																		
"1 production, so that Block 2 will be capable of meeting production targets when Block 1 is"																																		
depleted.																																		
Calculating Tonnes and Grades																																		
The Footprint Finder module of PCBC is suitable for providing rough scheduling for this level of																																		
study.																																		
Assumptions used when running Footprint Finder are as follow:																																		
"•	Full production rate is 67,500 tpd. This allows for explicit grade factor of 90% to be applied as"																																		
described in Section 18.1.2.																																		
"•	Production for 5 year ramp up time is calculated linearly based on full production."																																		
"•	Columns are mined at defined vertical mining rate of 100mm per day."																																		
The process that Footprint Finder follows when producing a schedule is as follows:																																		
"•	Highest value column is mined first."																																		
"•	Production is taken from adjacent columns as necessary to achieve required production."

"•	Once production starts on a column, it continues until the column intersects external dilution."																																		
"•	Mining progresses out from the initial columns radically."																																		
"•	Total tonnes, footprint area required, and average grade of material mined is output for each"																																		
year.																																		
Mineralized Development Rock																																		
Overbreak from all development and undercutting was assumed to be 10% and all development																																		
muck was assumed to have an insitu density of 3.7 t/m3.																																		
"For the calculation of total tonnage, undercut height was assumed to be 5m. The grade of each"																																		
undercut level was determined from the average grade of all mineralized blocks at the undercut																																		
elevation.																																		
Total mineralized development rock tonnages were calculated from individual development lengths																																		
and cross sectional areas. The quantities of each development type that are mined as mill feed or																																		
waste are based on a visual approximation and the average development grade is based on the																																		
average grade of areas of the block model occupied by development.

Ventilation																																		
"Total ventilation requirements were determined using a conservative factor, based on SRK"																																		
"experience, of 1 m3/s of air for each Kt of ROM rock produced per month. For a 75,000 tpd"																																		
"production rate, 2,250 m3/s of ventilation air will be required. The total pressure drop through the"																																		
mine was estimated to be 3.2 KPa. Using an assumed motor efficiency of 75% it was calculated that																																		
a total of 9.5 MW of fan power is required for the mine.																																		
Maintenance																																		
Equipment maintenance has been included in the development and mining costs used in this study.																																		
Maintenance of underground infrastructure such as drawpoints and concrete roadways has been																																		
included in the operating costs used in this study.																																		
Adequate mobile equipment for all maintenance activities has been included in the mobile equipment

"18.2	Recoverability"																																		
This report assumes a magnetic separation recovery of 93.4% of total iron. This estimate is based on																																		
metallurgical test work on Pampa de Pongo samples. Recovery assumptions for copper and gold are																																		
both 50% and are only based on experience from other operations. No metallurgical testing of copper																																		
and gold recoveries was done to support the assumed recoveries and is therefore unreliable. The																																		
payable copper and gold contribution to the cash flow is only about 3% of the total value.																																		
"18.3	Markets"																																		
"Unlike most metals which are openly traded, the iron ore market is a competitive market with the"																																		
majority of producers and consumers trading with each other directly under closed contractual																																		
"conditions. As iron ore is an internationally traded bulk material, with the transport costs a"																																		
"significant proportion of the delivered cost to customers, the relative locations of the suppliers and"																																		
consumers forms a very important component in the commodity’s economics.																																		
Pampa de Pongo is in an advantageous location to ship iron ore products to Asian or Indian markets.																																		
The Pampa de Pongo property lies 38 kilometres from an existing deep-water port on the Pacific																																		
coast.

"18.3.1	Iron Ore Market Background"																																		
"Most mining companies sell iron ore on a ‘Free On Board’ (‘FOB’) basis, at the port of origin. The"																																		
cost of shipping from the port of origin to the customer’s destination port is usually added to the																																		
FOB price and paid for by the customer and will vary for each individual customer. The basic prices																																		
at each destination port are effectively controlled by the FOB price at the major production centers																																		
"plus shipping costs. Delivered cost is usually referred to as ‘Cost, Insurance and Freight’ (“CIF”)."																																		
It is assumed that Pampa de Pongo will sell its iron ore products (blast furnace and potentially direct																																		
"reduction grade iron ore pellets) for similar prices that major companies such as Vale, Rio Tinto and"																																		
"BHP Billiton realize, at the same destination ports. Any advantage arising from differences in"																																		
shipping costs (due to the more favourable geographic location of the deposit) are a ‘plus’ to the																																		
overall costing structure.																																		
The price at destination port (CIF) is calculated as FOB Price plus shipping costs to destination.																																		
Pampa de Pongo’s FOB price would be Price at Destination minus Pampa de Pongo shipping costs																																		
"to Asia. Location is therefore extremely important. For example, the shipping cost associated with"																																		
"Brazilian iron ore pellets would be expected to be higher than that for Pampa de Pongo. Hence, the"																																		
FOB price for Brazilian iron ore pellets would be lower than that for Pampa de Pongo (on an																																		
equivalent percentage iron-grade basis).																																		
Shipping costs for Pampa de Pongo iron ore pellets to the target markets of Asia and India are																																		
"uncertain at this time. Pricing for this study was therefore determined by reference to historical,"																																		
current and long-term trends for world blast furnace pellets FOB.																																		
Current Iron Ore Markets																																		
"The years 2002-2003 saw a shift in the iron ore markets with sharply increasing demand, fuelled"																																		
primarily by economic and infrastructural growth in China. The iron industry responded with																																		
"increased iron ore production in tandem with much-publicized price increases for all products,"																																		
including blast furnace and direct reduction pellets.																																		
"In September 2008, Cardero retained Global Strategic Solutions Inc. to conduct an iron industry"																																		
"market study. The results were encouraging, generally forecasting sustained demand and market"																																		
"growth. Taking known future capacity into account, there will continue to be shortages of iron ore"																																		
"(42 Mt in 2010, reduced to 30 Mt by 2017) and a continuing year-on-year 3.9% growth in the steel"																																		
industry. Iron ore shortfalls are predicted despite expected increases in supply of 7% per year.																																		
The overall iron ore market is still forecast to grow and as a result the overall price trend is forecast																																		
"to continue rising. Aside for continuing market growth, factors contributing to iron ore prices include"																																		
"the cost of energy (natural gas and fuel oil), labour costs, and inflation."

Page 96																																		
Pampa de Pongo Pricing Assumptions																																		
"FOB pricing is usually expressed as US0/dmtu (US cents per dry metric tonne unit); in other words,"																																		
as the price per tonne for material grading 100% iron. To convert this figure to a more intuitive																																		
"US$/tonne, the dmtu figure is multiplied by the actual grade of the product being sold."																																		
"The long-term blast furnace iron ore pellet FOB price used for this study is presented as a low,"																																		
"long-term price, a higher price reflecting expected market growth and a third price, between the two."																																		
The low price is a calculated mean of 2006-2008 pricing from Vale’s Sao Luis operation in Brazil.																																		
The result is US0l54/dmtu ($99.35/tonne at 64.5% iron pellet grade). This figure is in line with long-																																		
"term forecasting from financial institutions, ranging between US0l35/dmtu to US0l64/dmtu, which"																																		
have historically been conservative prices.																																		
"The middle price is US0l98/dmtu ($128/tonne) and is sourced from an independent market study,"																																		
prepared for Cardero Resource Corp. by Global Strategic Solutions Inc.																																		
"The higher price, US0230/dmtu ($150/tonne @ 64.5% iron grade) is sourced from recent and"																																		
comparable iron project preliminary economic assessments. This price is considered to be most																																		
realistic as a prediction of future blast furnace pellet prices.																																		
"Following a positive Material Evaluation from MIDREX Technologies Inc., the Pampa de Pongo"																																		
pellets have been assessed as suitable for Direct Reduction process feed. DR-grade iron ore pellets																																		
typically carry a premium of 10% over blast furnace grade pellets as the processing requirements for																																		
gas based direct reduction plants are more stringent than that of the blast furnace. Pricing																																		
assumptions in the discounted cash-flow reflect this price premium.																																		
"18.4	Contracts"																																		
There are no contracts applicable to this report.																																		
"18.5	Environmental Considerations"																																		
No significant environmental work has been conducted on the project. Based on there being no																																		
communities which would be impacted directly by mining operations and the almost complete lack																																		
"of surface water, flora and fauna on the property, SRK does not envision any environmental fatal"																																		
flaws.																																		
The Government of Peru does not require payment of an environmental bond ahead of mine																																		
development.																																		
"18.6	Taxes"																																		
Peru has an 8% corporate income tax established to help distribute corporate profits to workers of all																																		
levels. The tax is used to compensate workers according to their specific wage categories as defined

by the Peruvian government. Contractors must contribute the 8% tax for their own workers. This tax																																		
is applied to taxable income prior to the calculation of regular corporate income tax.

Peru’s royalty payment requirements are shown in Table 18.14.

"18.6.2	Value Added Tax"																																		
There is a 19% value added tax in Peru for all goods and services. There are means to recovery this																																		
"tax back from the government and, as a result, the cash flow model does not show VAT as it is"																																		
assumed that full recovery of the value added tax will be realized.																																		
"18.6.3	Corporate Income Tax"																																		
Peruvian corporate income tax has been assumed to be 30% in this study. The actual income tax paid																																		
"will likely vary when detailed tax assessments are done, but 30% is considered appropriate for this"																																		
level of study.																																		
"18.6.4	Depreciation and Amortization"																																		
Depreciation and amortization were taken into account in the simplified cash flow calculation.																																		
Depreciation schedules were assumed to be as per Table 18.15. The capital costs in the cash flow																																		
model were only broadly categorized into depreciation classes and scheduled accordingly.

"18.7.2	Mineral Processing OPEX"																																		
Design and cost estimates are based on published technical papers as well as plant operating																																		
information regarding the OPEX and CAPEX of comparable plants and processes.																																		
Beneficiation																																		
The total OPEX for a comparable Peruvian Verde crushing and grinding circuit was estimated to be																																		
$1.695 per tonne. The Pampa de Pongo OPEX is assumed to be the same on this cost per tonne basis.																																		
An OPEX of $0.30/tonne has been estimated for the flotation circuit.																																		
"In addition to the liberation OPEX, the magnetic separation, vacuum disk filtering, and slurry"																																		
pipeline OPEX is estimated at $1.50/tonne of concentrate.																																		
Pelletization																																		
The average OPEX for two proposed 5 million tonne per year pellet plants (recent and comparable																																		
study) is $9.22 and was used as the basis for the Pampa de Pongo estimates after adjustment for																																		
Peruvian cost conditions.																																		
Electricity in Peru is $0.045 per kWhr compared to US$0.075 per kWhr in the reference host-																																		
"country, allowing a $1.42 deduction from the Pampa de Pongo OPEX. Mean labour costs in Peru are"																																		
"$13,746 per labourer year. Therefore, the labour OPEX per ton of pellets in Peru is US$0.344.,"																																		
compared to $2.65 in the reference project country. This allows a $2.31 deduction for the Pampa de																																		
Pongo OPEX. The total Pampa de Pongo pelletizing OPEX is estimated at $5.49 per tonne of pellets.

Development costs of drifts and ramps were estimated from first principle analysis of materials and																																		
labour for a standard sized development of 5 m wide by 5 m high. Costs of other development were																																		
extrapolated from this based on the difference of excavated volume. A rate of $600 per metre was																																		
added to drifts requiring a concrete floor.																																		
"Conveyor costs were based on another South American study at an installed cost of $15,000 per"																																		
metre for the conveyor drift and decline.																																		
"The costs of a raisebored and stripped shafts, lined “ore” passes and unlined vent raises are based on"																																		
SRK data from similar projects.																																		
A cost of $1500/m2 for constructing and expanding the extraction and undercut levels of a caving																																		
mine is based on costs being realized by current operating caving mines. This reflects the total costs																																		
of increasing a mine's footprint by 1m2 and includes in it the excavation of an undercut and the																																		
construction of required drawpoints.																																		
All undercut and drawpoint construction required prior to Year 1 is considered capital expense. All																																		
undercut and drawpoint construction after Year 1 is factored into the operating costs of the mine.																																		
"A total of $1,180 M in mine development capital will be spent over the life of the mine."

Stationary Equipment																																		
"•	Ventilation: Initial exploration ventilation has been estimated at $0.5 M in Year -5 and an"																																		
additional $0.5 M in Year -4. These capital costs will cover primary and auxiliary vent fans and																																		
ducting required to access the underground and support development work until ventilation																																		
shafts have been sunk and permanent ventilation fans have been installed in them.																																		
"•	For the permanent ventilation system, an installed ventilation plant cost, based on typical costs"																																		
"from other projects, of $2,000 per installed kW of required fan power has been used. The Pampa"																																		
de Pongo Mine will require 9.5 MW of power and is therefore estimated to cost $19 million.																																		
"•	Crushers: Two installed 75,000 tpd crushers including underground construction and"																																		
"infrastructure, (power, chutes, grizzlies, rockbreakers, etc.) were estimated to be $50M."																																		
"•	Material Transport: Conveyors were costed as part of capital development but the associated"																																		
"items such as transfer points, chutes, grizzlies, rockbreakers were estimated separately at $10 M."																																		
"•	Surface Stockpile/Reclaim: The surface stockpile and reclaim system for the ROM stockpile"																																		
were estimated to cost a total of $100 M.																																		
"•	Other: Shop equipment, pumps, and all other ancillary capital was estimated to be $56 M."																																		
Mobile Equipment																																		
Mobile equipment costs were provided by a major equipment manufacturer. Equipment costs not																																		
supplied by this manufacturer were taken from the 2007 Infomine Mine Cost Service List and were																																		
increased by 20% to adjust for inflation. All purchase costs had 15% added to cover the costs of																																		
capital spares and transportation to the mine site.																																		
Mobile equipment was purchased the year it is required in the mine. The lifespan of loading and																																		
"haulage equipment was based on an operating life of 15,000 hours for an LHD and 25,000 hours for"																																		
a haul truck. All remaining equipment was assumed to have a 5 or 10 year lifespan based on																																		
expected utilization. Replacements were scheduled over the entire life of the mine. It was assumed																																		
that no equipment will be rebuilt and that there is no salvage value at the end of equipment life. The																																		
"total LOM mining equipment capital was estimated to be $1,001M."																																		
It was assumed that all equipment required constructing the ventilation raises would be supplied by																																		
the contractor doing the construction.																																		
Surface Earthworks																																		
Major earthworks operations on surface will include the construction of a tailings impoundment																																		
"facility, portals for the underground declines and casings for the collars of the ventilation raises. The"																																		
tailings impoundment will be built using a combination mine waste rock and rock quarried from the																																		
local area. The topography of the Pampa de Pongo property does not provide a valley-fill tailings																																		
option. The impoundment will be built on relatively flat ground with a long perimeter waste rock

dam. The dam construction has been costed in three phases over the life of the mine and would be																																		
built using a mining/construction contractor. The total surface earthworks were estimated to be																																		
$188M over the mine life for tailings and $8M for other mine surface excavations.																																		
Surface Buildings																																		
"Mine related shop, offices, a dry, warehouse, explosive and cap magazines and a core storage facility"																																		
were included in pre-production capital for a total cost of $14 M.																																		
"18.8.2	Mineral Processing"																																		
Beneficiation																																		
The published capital cost of a comparable Peruvian crushing and grinding plant was $184.8																																		
(1.3 times the capacity required for Pampa de Pongo). The entire total installed cost of the																																		
"concentrator was calculated with a 0.77 power economy of scale and an escalation factor of 12%,"																																		
between 2006/2007 and current 2008 dollars. The Pampa de Pongo crushing and grinding circuit is																																		
therefore estimated to be $148 million and has been escalated to $166 million.																																		
Each of the fifteen concentrator lines (including rougher and cleaner magnetic separators and a																																		
"vacuum disk filter) has been estimated at $1 million, totalling $15 million. It is estimated that the"																																		
concentrate slurry pipeline will cost $1.2 million per km and will cost approximately $40.8 million.																																		
The smaller pipeline that will return water back to the mine has been estimated at approximately																																		
$0.6 million per km and will cost approximately $20.4 million. This will total $76.2 million in																																		
capital expenditures.																																		
A capital cost of $35 million has been estimated as a requirement for construction of flotation																																		
circuits for copper-gold recovery.																																		
Pelletization																																		
The estimated total installed cost of a South American pellet plant is $66 per annual ton based on an																																		
extensive and detailed economic feasibility study conducted by CAEMI of the Itabiritos plant in																																		
"Brazil. Therefore, a 15 million tonne per year pellet plant will cost approximately US$990 million"																																		
"with no economies of scale factored into the estimate. The addition of a pellet stacker-reclaimer,"																																		
"estimated at $20 million, brings total CAPEX to $1,010 million."

"18.9	Economic Analysis"																																		
The economic analysis conducted in this report uses inferred mineral resources exclusively and only																																		
"provides a preliminary overview of the project economics based on broad, factored assumptions."																																		
Inferred mineral resources are considered too speculative geologically to have the economic																																		
"considerations applied to them to be categorized as mineral reserves, and there is no certainty that the"																																		
inferred resources will be upgraded to a higher resource category. There is also no certainty that the																																		
results of this preliminary economic assessment will be realized.																																		
A simplified cash flow model was made to determine the pre and post-tax NPVs at various discount																																		
rates for each case. Copies of the cash flow models are shown in Appendix B. No accommodation																																		
has been made for the deduction of interest expenses prior to taxation. The model assumes that the																																		
project would be 100% equity financed.																																		
The economic analyses were performed on four different cases. Each case maintained the same basic																																		
parameters except for pellet prices which varied between 169 p/dmtu and 253 p/dmtu. Case 1 used a																																		
blast furnace pellet price of 198 p/mtu while the other cases used a range of direct reduction pellet																																		
prices. Sources for and reasoning behind the selected pellet prices are shown in the Table 18.20.

"18.9.1	Sensitivity Analysis"																																		
"Sensitivity analysis was done using metal prices, mill head grade, capital costs and operating costs as"																																		
variables. Each variable was changed independently while all other variables were held at the																																		
constant.																																		
The results of the sensitivity analysis are shown on graphs in Figures 18.11 to 18.14 and Table 18.24.																																		
"As with many mining projects, the net present value (“NPV”) of the project is most affected by the"																																		
"price of metal. This holds true for all the cases in this study. In Case 3, a 20% increase in metal"																																		
prices leads to an increase in the post-tax net present value using a 10% discount rate (“PT-NPVi0%”)																																		
"from $2.690M to $3,967M, a 48% increase. The mill head grade and recovery also have a similar"																																		
"large impact with a $1,220M PT-NPV10% gain for a 20% increase in grade or recovery. Conversely,"																																		
"decreases in metal prices, mill head grades or recoveries have a correspondingly large negative effect"																																		
on the NPV10%.																																		
"All cases indicate they are more sensitive to capital cost than operating cost. For Case 3, a 20%"																																		
increase in capital cost drops the PT-NPV10% by $521M or 19%. An increase in Case 3 OPEX yields																																		
a $218M drop (8%) in PT-NPV10%.

The mine life as defined by the LOM plan has 24 years of production preceded by two years of																																		
"construction and four years of exploration, permitting, engineering and procurement."																																		
The project has opportunity to increase mine life and/or production rate by bringing in resources																																		
"from the South Zone (± 115 Mt). The East Zone, although currently only an exploration target and"																																		
"not a mineral resource, also offers the potential for expanding the mine life and/or production rate if"																																		
"exploration drilling is successful and a mineral resource can be estimated. There is, however, no"																																		
guarantee that any of these zones will make it to a reserve category.

"19	Interpretation and Conclusions"																																		
"The results of this preliminary economic assessment indicate that, based on the preliminary data"																																		
"available and assumptions, the Pampa de Pongo Project is an economically robust project that"																																		
warrants further exploration and study. The project is situated in a very favourable location within a																																		
"short distance of infrastructure, including a deep-sea port facility, located 38 km west of the deposit."																																		
"Drilling and magnetic surveys infer the presence of a large, massive magnetite mineralized"																																		
Central Zone that is conducive to underground bulk mining. The South Zone resource and other																																		
"exploration targets, particularly the East Zone, may enhance the total material available for"																																		
exploitation.																																		
The metallurgy test work done on the Central Zone mineralization confirmed the production of pilot-																																		
scale direct reduction pellets with low levels of deleterious elements. It is the opinion of SRK that																																		
the samples selected for metallurgical testwork were representative within the current deposit																																		
knowledge.																																		
"An analysis of QA/QC data indicated that Fe, Cu and Au grades were reasonable for resource"																																		
estimation. Issues were flagged with the Rio Tinto deleterious assays. It is recommended that																																		
portions of the remaining RT core be re-assayed in order to build a more robust deleterious database.																																		
It is also recommended that Cardero employ their own independent QA/QC program which would																																		
include the regular assaying of duplicate pulps at a referee laboratory and the insertion of at least 3																																		
"certified standards reflecting mean deposit grade, cut off grade and a 66 percentile of “ore” grade"																																		
material. Retention of pulps and coarse rejects should become part of Cardero’s standard sample																																		
maintenance protocol.																																		
A review of the geological interpretation indicates that a reasonable geological model exists with																																		
which to estimate inferred mineral resources appropriate for a preliminary economic assessment.																																		
An assessment of deleterious elements indicated that no significant issues were evident. This																																		
observation was supported by bulk sample metallurgical testwork. A review of the block model and																																		
estimation parameters indicated that the procedures used were valid and appropriate for a																																		
preliminary economic assessment.																																		
"In SRK’s opinion, the Cardero Pampa de Pongo project shows good upside potential in further"																																		
increasing mineral resources.																																		
This has met its objectives and has provide a preliminary review of the Pampa de Pongo project																																		
including recommendations of further work.

"19.1	Risk and Opportunities"																																		
The currently defined Pampa the Pongo deposit has a number of risks and opportunities that will be																																		
better defined as further work is conducted. There are a number of factors that may affect the quality																																		
"or robustness of the current mineral resource estimates, and thereby highlight opportunities for"																																		
improvement. These are listed below:																																		
"•	Current geology model and by extension the resource estimates are defined to some extent from"																																		
"“soft” geophysical data. Actual size of the high grade Fe deposit, especially its lateral extents,"																																		
are at present not well defined from actual drilling.																																		
"•	Lack of drill density may result in variations in estimated resource tonnage and grade as a result"																																		
of infill drilling. The definition of additional fault structures within the mineralized zone could																																		
complicate production achievements.																																		
"•	Good potential exists to upgrade classification of the East Zone conceptual tonnes and grade"																																		
identified by drillhole PPD-004 and by magnetic data. The 350-500 conceptual tonnage offers																																		
significant upside to the project.																																		
"•	Several drillholes in the Central Zone were terminated very close to the lower most contact of"																																		
the Fe mineralization. SRK is of the opinion that the structurally controlled mineralizing systems																																		
may extend further to depth than what was modelled. Deeper drilling in subsequent infill drill																																		
programs is warranted.																																		
"•	SRK is of the opinion, that additional near surface smaller lenses of high grade iron formation"																																		
could be discovered on the Pampa de Pongo property. The 3D magnetic inversion in the vicinity																																		
of the South Zones represents a broad weaker magnetic anomaly which appears to be associated																																		
with relatively narrow thicknesses (<50m) of high grade iron formation. A good example is hole																																		
DDH04-10 which contains a 49m interval of high grade within a broad low intensity (0.15)																																		
magnetic contour. The potential existence of multiple smaller lenses of high grade is not																																		
dissimilar from the experience of the nearby operating Marcona Mine which has encountered																																		
many narrow lenses of high grade mineralization.																																		
"•	The suitability of the resource to a caving mining method is indicated but not confirmed and"																																		
"poses a large risk to the project. Non-caving methods, if required, would have a considerable"																																		
negative impact on mine costs and production capability.

"20	Recommendations"																																		
SRK recommends two stages of work to take Pampa de Pongo to the next level of development.																																		
These recommendations are described below. The Preliminary Economic Assessment will be																																		
"contingent upon the success of the East Zone exploration drilling, while the Pre-feasibility Study will"																																		
be contingent on the success of the definition drill programs of the East Zone and/or the Central																																		
Zone.																																		
"1.	East Zone Exploration & Preliminary Economic Assessment."																																		
Exploration of the East Zone should be accelerated and prioritized to allow concurrent development																																		
"with Central Zone, assuming positive results. Critical work items include:"																																		
"•	Exploration Drilling - six holes to prove economic potential and determine Inferred"																																		
"Resources (4,500 metres)."																																		
"•	Preliminary Economic Assessment - Scoping level assessment including conceptual mine"																																		
"design, resource estimate, metallurgy and economic value. The critical aspect would be to"																																		
"determine if the potential resource could be developed concurrently with Central Zone,"																																		
increasing the annual output of the operation.																																		
"2.	Central and East Zone Pre-feasibility Study"																																		
The major components of the study should be as follows:																																		
"•	Central Zone Definition Drilling - approximately 17 drillholes, totalling 14,500m, resulting"																																		
in a 200-metre drill spacing. This should be sufficient to upgrade existing resources from																																		
Inferred Resources to at least an Indicated Resource category. All permits are in pace to																																		
complete this work.																																		
"•	East Zone Definition Drilling - Rapid definition drilling to dovetail preliminary feasibility-"																																		
level work with that being undertaken for Central Zone. This drilling would comprise																																		
"approximately six additional drillholes for 4,500 metres."																																		
"•	Geotechnical Studies - concurrent with definition drilling, detailed geotechnical analysis"																																		
including further structural definition and hydrogeology.																																		
"•	Environmental baseline - environmental monitoring, including groundwater assessment and"																																		
preparation of Environmental Impact Assessment.																																		
"•	Metallurgy - Multiple bench-scale metallurgical tests to quantify metallurgical variation"																																		
within the Central Zone. Further development of the furnace firing cycle to optimize and																																		
enhance blast furnace pellet quality. Additional grinding to reduce silica even further and																																		
conversely increase total iron grade in the pellets.

"• Central Zone Condemnation Drilling - If not already defined through definition drilling, the"																																		
outer edges of the Central Zone must be defined through up to 5 condemnation drillholes for																																		
"a total of 4,250 metres."																																		
Costs are based on a contractor quote of $120/m drilled and an estimated geotechnical logging and																																		
assaying cost of $30/m drilled.

"1	Geotechnical Evaluation"																																		
A preliminary geotechnical evaluation has been conducted to assess and characterize the rock mass																																		
of the Central and South Zones for open pit and underground mining development options. Based on																																		
"this evaluation, input recommendations for mining method selection and potential mine design"																																		
parameters are provided.																																		
This evaluation is based on a limited number of exploration holes that have been drilled at the site by																																		
both Rio Tinto and Cardero Resource Corporation (“Cardero”). Of the 28 drillholes completed at the																																		
"Pampa De Pongo project, the Central Zone and South Zones each have five holes that intersect the"																																		
inferred resource.																																		
Information used for the geotechnical evaluation included:																																		
"·	Drillhole logs for Rio Tinto and Cardero. Cardero drillholes included RQD and recovery data."																																		
RQD values were not available for Rio Tinto drillholes;																																		
"·	Core photographs for all Cardero and Rio Tinto (split core only) drillholes;"																																		
"·	The June 2008 structural report prepared by SRK Consulting entitled “Evaluation of the"																																		
"Structural Geology of the Pampa de Pongo Fe Project, Peru.”"																																		
"The geotechnical evaluation included a review of representative cores in the Lima core yard,"																																		
followed by a comprehensive review of the drillhole photographs of all the available drillholes in the																																		
"zones of interest. Rock mass rating (RMR, Laubscher 1990) geotechnical parameters were estimated"																																		
"for all the sections of the cores. From this assessment, broad geotechnical domains were determined"																																		
and a representative range for likely RMR’s determined for each of the domains.

The geotechnical domains at the Pampa de Pongo project can be separated into four basic units:																																		
"Overburden, massive style mineralization, semi-massive mineralization, and country rock. The"																																		
following sections present geotechnical descriptions and parameters for the Central and South Zones																																		
at Pampa de Pongo.																																		
"2.1	Geotechnical Description - Central Zone"																																		
Figure 1 presents the geotechnical cross-section developed based on preliminary domains; rock mass																																		
"conditions were assigned as ‘poor’ (brown), ‘fair’ (yellow), and ‘good’ (green). Figure 2 and Figure"																																		
3 present the drillhole data (RQD) and photo profiles used in the geotechnical evaluation. Figure 4																																		
and Figure 5 present RQD histograms (all Zones) and graphs (Central Zone only) for the																																		
geotechnical units at Pampa de Pongo. It should be noted that the histograms show the RQD as																																		
logged by Cardero staff: the RQD is considered to be conservative due to the inclusion of all core																																		
breaks in the RQD measurement.																																		
"2.1.1	Overburden"																																		
Overburden depths of between 30 - 40m are encountered above the Central Zone mineralization. A																																		
tricone bit was used to seat casing and there was no recovery of these materials. Brief descriptions																																		
of these materials in drillhole logs indicate that the overburden materials in the Central Zone are																																		
similar to those seen in thicker intersections in the South Zone.																																		
"2.1.2	Country Rock"																																		
Country rock lithologies at the Central Zone primarily consist of fine and coarse grained																																		
"volcaniclastic and dyke (Ocoite) units. Conditions around the mineralized zone are variable, with"																																		
rock mass conditions for all units within the fair range (estimated RMR 40 - 50). Significant zones																																		
"of broken rock are observed in the drillholes, especially above the central zone mineralization where"																																		
conditions appear to deteriorate with depth (Figure 6 and Figure 7).

The mineralization at Pampa de Pongo can be separated into two main geological types: massive and																																		
semi-massive style magnetite. In general the massive mineralization occurs at depth below the semi-																																		
massive mineralization.																																		
"The massive style mineralization (Figure 8) is generally considered to be of fair rock mass quality,"																																		
with RMR values estimated between 45 and 55; the lower RMR values indicating increased																																		
"rockmass alteration. Where major structures intersect the mineralization, RMR values are estimated"																																		
at 25 - 35.

"2.1.4	Design Parameters - Central Zone"																																		
"Based on the estimated RMR values established in the geotechnical evaluation, the design"																																		
parameters in Table 1 have been developed for the underground mining analysis.																																		
Table 1 Central Zone Geotechnical Parameters																																		
Domain	RMR	Caving Hydraulic Radius																																
Country rock	40 - 50	20 - 27																																
Massive mineralization	45 - 55	24 - 30

Hydraulic Radius (HR) is a parameter that characterizes the rock mass potential to cave. The																																		
hydraulic radius is the minimum footprint dimensions required to be opened to ensure																																		
commencement of the cave.																																		
The preliminary evaluation of the Central Zone geotechnical characteristics indicate that this																																		
mineralization may be considered suitable for bulk mining (caving) methods. Figure 10 shows the																																		
Pampa de Pongo Central Zone hydraulic radius requirements per domain in relation to other caving																																		
"projects (Laubscher, 2000). No MRMR adjustments are applied as the project is in the early stages"																																		
of evaluation and information on these adjustments is not available. The hydraulic radius of the																																		
Central Zone is markedly smaller than the mineralization footprint.

An open pit scenario has been reviewed for the Central Zone. A pit exploiting the Central Zone																																		
mineralization requires a low overall slope angle due to the possible depth (~800m) and rock mass																																		
characteristics. Table 2 presents the recommended slope angles based on the possible final pit depth.

"2.1.5	Support Requirements"																																		
The support recommendations presented here are based on practical experience in good rock mass																																		
"conditions. Where weak or poor ground conditions are encountered, increased support in the form of"																																		
"additional/longer bolts, increased shotcrete thickness, and mesh will be required."																																		
Access: These will require 2.4m fully resin grouted rebar at 1.2m spacing with 50mm fibercrete.																																		
Mesh will be required on some areas.																																		
Undercut Level: The under-cut will require 2.4m fully grouted resin rebar and fibercrete or mesh																																		
reinforced shotcrete (100mm). The bolt spacing should be on a 1.0m x 1.0m pattern.																																		
Production drives and stubs: These require 3.0m full column grouted resin rebar on a 1.0m spacing																																		
"and mesh reinforced shotcrete (100mm), and a 0.3m thick reinforced concrete floor. Cable bolts (6m)"																																		
"should be installed in the back and sidewalls at each intersection on 2.0m centers. In addition,"																																		
"bull-noses should be supported with cables and straps spaced at 1.0m, 4 cables each."																																		
Drawpoints: Flat back “Henderson type” arches (2-3 sets) to be installed at the brow of each																																		
drawpoint and concreted in place. Six meter long cables on a 1.0m spacing to be installed to anchor																																		
the system to the rock mass. The floors are to be concreted with rails.																																		
"2.2	Geotechnical Description and Design Parameters - South Zone"																																		
Geotechnical cross-sections for the S1 and S2 Zones (Figure 11 and Figure 12 respectively) have																																		
been developed based on the preliminary rockmass evaluation; rock mass conditions were assigned																																		
"as ‘poor’ (brown), ‘fair’ (yellow), and ‘good’ (green). Figure 13 and Figure 14 present photo profiles"																																		
of the overburden materials and graphs of the drillhole data (Figure 15).

Partial extraction mining methods could be considered in the South Zones. Cave mining methods																																		
including sub-level caving are not considered feasible due to the unfavorable mineralization																																		
"geometry, weak overburden materials, and the limited caving dimensions achievable within the weak"																																		
mineralization.																																		
Preliminary assessments of stoping in the South Zone indicate that extraction of approximately 50%																																		
or less is achievable without backfill. Extraction is compromised by having to maintain large crown																																		
"pillars to support the overlying weak overburden. In the S1 Zone, extraction is further complicated"																																		
by the mineralization height and maintaining a system of superimposed pillars and stopes.																																		
"Based on the geotechnical review, an open pit scenario could also been considered for the S1 Zone."																																		
The overburden pit wall slope for a potential S1 Zone pit would have to be at a very shallow angle																																		
"(26 ) due to conglomerate cementation that is predominantly weak, as seen as large zones of loose"																																		
sand in drill core. Additional holes in the overburden may be able to further define the overburden																																		
characteristics and strength variability. In this situation the slope angles presented in are																																		
recommended:

"3	Discussion"																																		
The design parameters and support requirements presented here are based on the rockmass																																		
"conditions, observed in the limited drilling undertaken during the Cardero Resources and Rio Tinto"																																		
"drilling programs. Because of the size of the deposit and the current drillhole coverage, the"																																		
conditions observed may not be typical of those observed elsewhere in the deposit.																																		
Comparison between Cardero and Rio Tinto drilling shows a significant difference in the quality of																																		
"recovered core. In general within the mineralized zones, the Rio Tinto drillholes display a much"																																		
higher quality rock mass even after cutting of the core with a core saw. Attempts have been made to																																		
"remove impacts of adverse drilling, core handling, and sampling in the geotechnical evaluation."																																		
These differences in drill core quality may be the result of:																																		
"·	Varied drilling techniques (e.g. drill damage as a result of double tube drilling for the Cardero"																																		
Holes);																																		
"·	Drillhole location indicating possible variable conditions both within the mineralized zone and in"																																		
the country rock. This situation is prevalent in the mineralized zone and it is unclear whether																																		
massive and semi-massive lithologies are poddy in nature or lenticular horizons.																																		
"Significant broken zones are observed within the country rock, and may be related to major"																																		
structures in the area. It is also possible that drilling techniques and sampling methods employed																																		
may have further exacerbated the extent of the damage observed within the core. This is especially																																		
evident beneath the S2 Zone where rockmass conditions are observed to be very poor. Based on this																																		
"information, it was decided that any underground infrastructure would have to be carried in the"																																		
mineralization where better conditions exist.																																		
"Overburden materials overlying the South Zone are fine to coarse-grained, variably cemented"																																		
sedimentary units and are not considered to be suitable for standard underground development																																		
"without substantial increased support costs. Similarly from a caving (or pillar wrecking) perspective,"																																		
these materials have the potential for preferential draw resulting in increased dilution and loss of																																		
production headings.

Executive Summary																																		
SRK was requested by Cardero Resources to conduct a desktop study of the structural geology of the																																		
"Pampa de Pongo Fe Project, Peru as a guide to modelling in advance of a resource estimation"																																		
exercise and scoping study. The study involved the review and integration of various datasets																																		
"provided by Cardero, including: geological maps and sections, geophysical maps, reports, logs and"																																		
core photos of drillholes.																																		
"Fe-mineralisation at Pampa de Pongo is characterised by several large magnetite bodies, of loose"																																		
"Iron-Oxide-Copper-Gold affiliation, which replace a Paleozoic to Mesozoic succession of volcanics"																																		
and sediments.																																		
"Although data quality from Pampa de Pongo is relatively goods, the data is relatively sparse because"																																		
of the current stage of exploration and also because of the lack of any outcrop. Therefore																																		
interpretations made throughout the study must be viewed as tentative and likely to change																																		
considerably during the planned definition drilling.																																		
Fe-mineralisation is hosted by the regional-scale NNW-trending Huaca fault system. In the vicinity																																		
of Pampa de Pongo ENE-trending faults affiliated to the Repiticion Group of Hawkes et al (2002)																																		
"intersect this structure. In addition, a WNW-trending structural fabric is observed on magnetic"																																		
survey maps (Analytic Signal). The deposit is therefore expected to be affected by brittle fault																																		
"structures, including some significant fault zones."																																		
Photographs of drillcore preserve evidence of significant numbers of brittle structures in the Pampa																																		
de Pongo area. The cores are affected by numerous broken and gougey zones associated with																																		
moderate to steeply-dipping slip surfaces. It has not been possible to validate the precise nature and																																		
style of faulting which have been reported elsewhere in the Marcona District.																																		
Three cross-sections have been constructed along the main drill fences in the Central and Southern																																		
zones of the Pampa de Pongo deposits. The modelled geology is very tentative due to the scarcity of																																		
"data on the geological structures and relies on magnetic inversions to a large extent. However,"																																		
correlation of the geology from drilling with the magnetic model is not straightforward. Caution is																																		
advised in the use of the magnetic inversion models as a simple proxy of the 3D geometry of the																																		
resource.																																		
"It is recommended that Cardero construct a robust fault model, making use of: structural"																																		
measurements from oriented core together with descriptions and correlations based on well-																																		
preserved core from the upcoming drill campaign. Uncertainty in the geometry of the deposits may																																		
be improved by collecting orientations of (relict) bedding together with the identification of marker																																		
"horizons. Measurements of all intrusive ocoite contacts, particularly in moderately inclined"																																		
"drillholes, will help to assess the presence or absence of steep ocoite dykes, which are suspected and"																																		
may contribute to dilution of the Fe resource.

"1	Introduction and Scope of Report"																																		
"In February 2008, Keith Henderson, VP of Exploration, Cardero Resource Corp. (Cardero) requested"																																		
SRK Consulting (Canada) Ltd (SRK) to conduct a desktop study of the structural geology of the																																		
"Pampa de Pongo Fe Project, Peru. The study was intended to assist as a guide to modelling of the"																																		
"Pampa de Pongo resource in advance of a resource estimation update and scoping study, as well as to"																																		
"assist with drillhole placement in an upcoming 30,000m drillhole campaign, permitted for 2008-2009"																																		
(Cardero press release 28th May 2008).																																		
The study was conducted between April and June 2008 and utilised all data made available to SRK																																		
"by Cardero, including: geological maps and sections, geophysical maps, logs and core photos of"																																		
"drillholes,. At the time of the study Cardero was in the process of transferring the geographical"																																		
coordinates of their data from the PSAD56 datum to WGS84. This resulted in a small delay to the																																		
study.																																		
All technical work was carried out by Chris Bonson (Senior Structural Geologist) and David Trippett																																		
(Associate Geologist).																																		
This report is intended for internal use by Cardero Resource Inc. and is not intended for public																																		
disclosure.																																		
"2	Objectives"																																		
The principal objectives of the study as originally planned were to:																																		
"•	Determine the controls on the deposit on a local scale and within the regional structural"																																		
framework;																																		
"•	Produce several cross-sections of the geology of the resource to assist the upcoming resource"																																		
estimation;																																		
"•	Provide guidance in the logging of structures within drillcore by the providing a set of"																																		
structural logging guidelines and parameters to be measured (to be sent separately).																																		
The planned objectives were largely adhered to throughout the program.																																		
"3	Work Carried-out"																																		
The work carried-out consisted of the following tasks.																																		
• Review of reports and available data;

"•	Identification of faulted intervals from photographs of drillcore and compilation of a down-"																																		
hole structural dataset;																																		
• Interpretation of magnetic data and integration with available map data;																																		
"•	Synthesis of lithological and structural data in 3D Gemcom dataset and construction of"																																		
cross-sections.																																		
"4	Geological Framework"																																		
"4.1	Overview"																																		
The Pampa de Pongo Fe Project is located within a belt of deposits approximately 70km wide																																		
stretching along the Andean margin of Peru for some 400km. Deposits of this belt have a mineralogy																																		
"dominated by Fe-oxides, magnetite and hematite, and are grouped together under the general Iron-"																																		
Oxide-Copper-Gold classification (IOCG; Hawkes et al. 2002).																																		
"Within the belt, Pampa de Pongo lies at the southern extent of a cluster of large Fe-dominated"																																		
"mineral deposits known as the Marcona Fe-Cu District, named after the Marcona Mine - where total"																																		
resources approximate 1440 Mt of 54.1% Fe and 0.11% Cu (Hawkes et al. 2002). Cardero recently																																		
"announced a NI 43-101 compliant resource of 953 million tonnes averaging 44.7% Fe, 0.12% Cu,"																																		
"0.09 g/t for the Pampa de Pongo Project (Cardero press release, 6th September, 2005)."																																		
"4.2	Stratigraphy of the Marcona District"																																		
A summarised stratigraphic column of the Marcona District from Hawkes et al. (2002) is shown in																																		
"Figure 1 and includes a Precambrian basement gneiss complex, overlain by Paleozoic age dolomites,"																																		
limestones and sediments and a thick succession of Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous volcanic rocks																																		
and sediments.																																		
"The basement of the district, referred to as the Coastal Basal Complex, comprises gneisses,"																																		
migmatites and granites. These are overlain by a succession of upper Precambrian and Paleozoic age																																		
"sediments, predominantly dolomitic marbles and limestones with pelites and minor quartzites,"																																		
known as the San Juan and Marcona Formations. It is important to note that in the exploration																																		
"conducted by Rio Tinto, these two formations were unified and referred to as the Marcona Formation"																																		
owing to their similarity (Hawkes et al. 2003).																																		
"The thick Jurassic to Cretaceous age volcano-sedimentary pile is subdivided into the Rio Grande,"																																		
Jahuay and Yauca Formations. The Jurassic Rio Grande and overlying Jahuay Formations consist																																		
"predominantly of andesitic composition volcanic rocks, clastic sediments and limestones, whereas"																																		
"the Cretaceous Yauca Formation includes mostly fine-grained sediments, lesser sandstone and"																																		
negligible volcanic rocks.

"4.3	Intrusive Rocks"																																		
"The Marcona statigraphy hosts a range of intrusive rocks, summarised from Hawkes et al. (2002) in"																																		
broad chronological order as follows:																																		
"•	San Nicolas Batholith - Silurian age (390 ± 23-46 Ma; 425 ± 4 Ma; U-Pb zircon)"																																		
monzogranitic to dioritic rocks which intrude the Coastal Basal Complex and part of the																																		
Paleozoic succession.																																		
"•	Minor pre-mineral dacite dykes and sills cut the Marcona Formation (observed at the"																																		
Marcona Mine).																																		
"•	Porphyritic andesite (“Ocoite”) dykes, stocks and plutons of the Tunga andesites intrude"																																		
Paleozoic to Upper Jurassic rocks.																																		
"•	Upper Cretaceous to Paleocene granitoids intrude the whole succession, forming the Coastal"																																		
Batholith to the east of the Marcona District.																																		
"4.4	Structure"																																		
The rocks of the Marcona District are predominantly affected by tilting and displacements associated																																		
with several brittle fault systems affecting the Andean margin. Three principal systems of faults have																																		
been defined by Hawkes et al. (2002) and are summarised in Table 1.																																		
"Table 1: Summary of fault systems in the Marcona District, based on Hawkes et al. (2002)."																																		
"Fault
System"	Strike	Dip	Sense	Timing	Notes																													
Pista	295	60 N	Normal	Pre- & Post-ore																														
Repiticion	45	65NW	Reverse	?	Commonly parallel to stratigraphy																													
Huaca	335	60 E	Normal	Pre- to Post-ore																														
"A cross-sectional interpretation by Hawkes et al. (2002) is shown in Figure 2, the accuracy of which"																																		
"is unknown.. From the section, it is evident that all of the faults of the different systems represented"																																		
have large apparent normal displacements (approx. 250m to >1000m) and that significant bed dips																																		
(up to 45°) have resulted as a function of these displacements. Stratigraphic dips in the Pampa de																																		
"Pongo district, immediately to the west of the deposit area, are reportedly gentle towards the east"																																		
(Hawkes et al. 2003).																																		
"4.5	Fe Mineralisation"																																		
The Pampa de Pongo Fe deposits are a series of massive magnetite replacement bodies associated																																		
with a complex alteration history with widespread serpentinsation and albitisation (Hawkes et al.																																		
2003). Localised magnetic highs separated by areas of low magnetic response and intensity shown in																																		
magnetic survey data (Figures 3-5) indicate that the multiple separate deposits exist in the area. The																																		
three largest anomalies have been tested by exploration to date and have confirmed the presence of																																		
"Fe mineralisation. These are referred to as the Northern, Central and Southern Zones."

"Mineralisation has several forms including fracture fill, hydrothermal breccias and massive"																																		
"replacement, particularly of dolomitic sediments. Fe sulphides occur within some areas of the"																																		
magnetite mineralisation and the presence of chalcopyrite locally gives rise to anomalous Cu-Au																																		
values (Hawkes et al. 2003).

"5	Interpretation of Map Data"																																		
"5.1	Magnetic Survey Data"																																		
Raster images of processed magnetic maps were received from Cardero as MapInfo files. The most																																		
useful of these images for structural interpretation were maps of the Analytic Signal (AS) and Total																																		
"Magnetic Intensity (TMI), shown in Figures 3 and 4. The TMI image provides the best 2D"																																		
"constraints on the location and geometry of the magnetite mineralisation, where as the AS data"																																		
yielded the highest resolution imaging of apparent structures.																																		
Interpretation of the AS image has allowed definition of a series of west-northwest (310°) trending																																		
linear features running throughout the Pampa de Pongo project area (Figure 3). Although relatively																																		
"feint, the linear features have a relatively consistent orientation, the most prominent of which are"																																		
spaced approximately 600-700m apart. These features may represent an inherited structural grain																																		
within the Paleozoic and Precambrian basement rocks; this general northwest orientation is a																																		
"common basement structural trend throughout the central and southern Andes. Other possibilities,"																																		
"such as dipping strata, can not be ruled out however."																																		
The AS data also allows the definition of two major north-northwest (330°) structures (Figure 3)																																		
"which define the zone which hosts the Pampa de Pongo iron mineralisation, pertaining to the Huaca"

fault system (Hawkes et al. 2002; Table 1). Also several strong breaks which run east-northeasterly																																		
(065°) can be interpreted relatively confidently. These generally correlate to geomorphic structures																																		
(interpreted faults along valleys) from Aster imagery. The latter are likely to correspond to the																																		
Repiticion Faults of Hawkes et al. (2002; Table 1).																																		
Interpretation of structures from the TMI imagery concentrated on trying to define major structural																																		
"breaks, based on high gradients in the magnetic intensity; only few of these exist. Several of the"																																		
faults were interpreted on the imagery were based on the presence of interpreted major structures in																																		
section (see below).																																		
The correlation between the structures from the two datasets is difficult due to the scarcity of																																		
"interpreted structures from the TMI imagery. However, a reasonable correlation exists between the"																																		
"general orientation of the AS structural grain and several of the major faults on the TMI imagery,"																																		
particularly those of the ENE trending Repiticion system.																																		
"As well as the raster images of the processed magnetic survey, several 3D magnetic inversion"																																		
datasets were provided to SRK. There were processed into 3D surfaces in Leapfrog and used to																																		
constrain the cross-sectional interpretation of the Pampa de Pongo geology when imported in to a																																		
Gemcom 3D model of the proect (Figure 5).																																		
"5.2	Aster Data"																																		
"Due to the low lying, covered nature of the Pampa de Pongo project there are few constraints on"																																		
structures from surface features. Aster data of the more mountainous area to the east of the deposit																																		
has helped define several structures based on geomorphic features (quebradas etc..). The features of																																		
particular relevance are east-northeast trending and correlate spatially with the presence of such																																		
features on the AS and TMI imagery.

"6	Fault Descriptions from Core Photos"																																		
"6.1	Classification of Structural Zones from Core Photos"																																		
In order to constrain the presence and nature of major structures affecting the Pampa de Pongo																																		
"deposits, photographs of all diamond drill cores penetrating the solid geology were examined for"																																		
geological structures. The photos provided by Cardero captured the recent drillcores before splitting																																		
(2004 Cardero holes) and older cores after splitting (1995 RT holes). The latter split core photos																																		
"therefore do not provide an equal representation of the structures. For this reason, and because of the"																																		
"time/budget limits imposed on the project, the approach to the classification of the structure of the"																																		
cores was simplified.																																		
The brittle deformation in the core photographs was classified into the following categories:																																		
"•	Broken - significant lengths of the cores are fragmented into 5-10cm pieces, especially in the"																																		
RT split core. Therefore only intervals of the core that show a marked increase in the																																		
fracture frequency (reduction in fragment size) have been attributed to tectonic processes																																		
and assigned the ‘broken’ classification. It cannot be ruled-out that some smaller ‘broken’																																		
"intervals may be due to drilling damage. However, commonly striated slip surfaces were"																																		
partially preserved within or adjacent to intervals classed as ‘broken’ (Figures 6 and 7).																																		
"•	Broken with gouge - as above but with the presence of clay fault gouge within the intensely"																																		
broken rock Figure 7).																																		
"•	Gouge - within larger ‘broken with gouge’ intervals, areas of significant gouge were"																																		
"recorded, where possible, to better locate the zones of strain localisation, i.e., through-going"																																		
discrete structures within the zone.																																		
"•	Cemented breccia - localised zones of hydrothermal breccia cemented by epidote and/or"																																		
calcite occur within the magnetite mineralised intervals.																																		
"•	Vein fault - metre-scale veins of predominantly calcite, interpreted to be localised within a"																																		
locally dilational fault segment.																																		
"6.2	General Fault Observations"																																		
"With the exception of Precambrian gneisses occurring at the bottom of two drillholes, deformation"																																		
affecting the rocks at Pampa de Pongo appears to be essentially brittle in character. Localised ductile																																		
"shear zones are known to affect similar deposits elsewhere in the central Andes (e.g. Candelaria,"																																		
Arevalo et al. 2006) but have not been observed here.																																		
CGB																																		
Jun-08																																		
SRK Consulting																																		
Pampa de Pongo - Structural Evaluation																																		
Page 11																																		
Drillcores from the Pampa de Pongo project contain abundant brittle faults which appear to cut both																																		
the magnetite-dominated mineralisation and are consistent with those from elsewhere in the Marcona																																		
region; implying that the Pampa de Pongo orebodies may be offset by significant displacements.																																		
"Although faulting is not ubiquitous, most holes are affected by intervals of broken core which, to"																																		
"some extent, appear to be related to fault deformation. From core photos it is not possible to confirm"																																		
"the precise nature of the deformation of the intervals of broken core all of the time, however, many"																																		
"of these intervals are punctuated with finer grained and often clay-rich material, interpreted to be"																																		
fault gouge.																																		
Holes with significant intervals of fractured rock are highlighted in Table 2. Several exceptional																																		
intervals of broken rock and broken and gougey material in excess of 20m are interpreted to show																																		
"the presence of significant zones of fault deformation, most probably intercepted by the drill at very"																																		
"shallow angles. Typically, apparent shear surfaces within the faulted zones occur at a low angle to"																																		
"the core axis, which supports this interpretation and also indicates that most faults are moderate or"																																		
steeply dipping.

"across the Southern Zone, which replaces the Cardero section which is more WNW-oriented."																																		
"Construction of the cross-sections utilised all available data, but was constrained in particular by"																																		
"lithological coding of the drillholes, interpreted structural intervals from core photos and interpreted"																																		
faults from the TMI image. Although many structures have been interpreted from the drill core																																		
"photographs, only relatively few have been used in structural correlations. The cross-sections"																																		
therefore represent a major simplification of the geology.																																		
"Given the scarcity of data available relative to the size and potential complexity of the resource, the"																																		
interpretation is far from unique and therefore can only be assigned a relatively low-confidence level.																																		
7.1 Section 1: South Zone																																		
"The most southerly anomaly drilled, the South Zone, is not apparently affected by ocoite sills and"																																		
dykes (Figures 8 and 9). The presence of Basal Complex gneisses in the base of holes PPD008 and																																		
"PPD009 indicates that mineralisation occurs at a lower level in the succession than the Central Zone,"																																		
where ocoite sills are thought to exploit layering within the volcano-sedimentary succession																																		
"(Hawkes et al. 2003). At present, there is insufficient drill coverage to indicate whether steep or"																																		
subvertical dykes are present on any significant scale throughout the South Zone.																																		
Based on the absence of mineralisation in hole DDH04-13 and the presence of a significant thickness																																		
"of Jurassic or Cretaceous volcanic rocks, the Southern Zone is interpreted to be terminated by a fault"																																		
to the west-southwest. Displacement on this fault zone must have a considerable component of																																		
"vertical, down-to-the-East movement, as Basal Complex gneiss (PPD008 and PPD009) occurs at the"																																		
"same level as volcanic rocks (DDH04-13). Here, this is interpreted to be normal displacement,"																																		
consistent with descriptions from elsewhere in the Marcona vicinity (Hawkes et al. 2002). A																																		
significant transcurrent (strike-slip) component cannot be ruled-out however.																																		
The northern margin of the Southern Zone is interpreted to be displaced by an east-northeasterly																																		
"trending fault. The dip of the fault is unknown but has been interpreted to be a steep reverse fault,"																																		
consistent with the Pista fault system of the Marcona District (Hawkes et al. 2002).																																		
A steep fault is tentatively interpreted between DDH04-19 and PPD008 based on the close proximity																																		
"of Precambrian gneiss and Mesozoic volcanics at the same structural level, in addition to the"																																		
presence of broken core intervals in both holes. Similar juxtapositions have been noted in the																																		
"Marcona region by Hawkes et al. (2002), who infer complex basement faulting to account for this."																																		
"Alternatively, however, this may reflect an unconformity with significant relief."

"7.2	Section 2: Central Zone (E-W)"																																		
The Central Zone in E-W section (Figures 8 and 10) is interpreted to consist of two zones of																																		
"magnetite-dominated mineralisation, separated by a thick (50-200m) shallow-dipping ocoite"																																		
"package. Although the lower zone appears to be mostly massive or semi-massive magnetite, the"																																		
"upper zone appears more mixed, particularly in holes PPD001 and DDH04-21. In these holes, there"																																		
"is also some replacement of an early(?) ocoite phase, an anomaly that may be accounted for by the"																																		
proximity of these holes to a significant fault zone dipping to the south (out of plane). Although in																																		
"the model, the upper mineralisation has been extrapolated laterally to drillholes PPR003 and"																																		
"PPR004, this is very tentative as the nature of mineralisation in the latter holes differs from PPD001"																																		
and DDH04-21 (less mixed and not apparently replacing ocoite).																																		
The mineralisation is interpreted to be terminated in the east against a WNW-trending fault (Fault																																		
"A). This was interpreted on the basis of the TMI magnetics, which show very high gradients in this"																																		
"zone, and the presence of a significant zone of faulting in hole PPD003. There is no data in the"																																		
hangingwall of this fault to indicate the presence or absence of iron mineralisation. From the																																		
"magnetics, however, any mineralisation is likely to be either considerably thinner or much deeper."																																		
"It is worth noting that, as well as the south-dipping fault (Fault B) in section 2, interpreted to dip out"																																		
"of section, from the correlation of faulted and broken intervals within holes PPD001 and DDH04-21,"																																		
it appears likely that other potentially significant fault structures may also dip in this direction at																																		
depths of 400-600m in the magnetite.																																		
"Bedding data (bedding-core intercept angles) are present in scarce numbers in the Cardero drill logs,"																																		
but have not been readily used in this study because of the 3D uncertainties involved (unknown dip																																		
direction). The bed dips reported by Cardero range from 20°-60° and are typically around 30°-40°.																																		
"However, these dips contrast with those from surface maps of Rio Tinto. Given the scarcity of the"																																		
data it has not been possible to determine the validity or explanation for either set of values.																																		
"7.3	Section 3: Central Zone (N-S)"																																		
"In N-S cross-section (Figures 8 and 11), the Central Zone is interpreted to be terminated to the north"																																		
"by a significant fault (Fault A): a steep NNW-trending, ENE-dipping fault that is also interpreted on"																																		
section 2 (Figure 10). The massive iron mineralisation at depth is interpreted to thin to the south																																		
across Fault C. The faults interpreted in Section 3 are strongly influenced by the shape of the																																		
magnetic inversion model. Although this provides a good indication of the presence or absence of																																		
"magnetite mineralisation in the subsurface, the magnetic anomaly on which it is based results from"																																		
"the combination complex geological relationships, depth to mineralisation, thickness of"																																		
"mineralisation, grade etc... Therefore, rationalising the geology in drillcore with the magnetic model"																																		
is not straightforward. Caution is advised in the use of the magnetic inversion models as a simple																																		
proxy of the 3D geometry of the resource.

"8	Structural Controls on Mineralisation"																																		
"Given the current data constraints, the structural controls on Fe mineralisation at Pampa de Pongo"																																		
are still relatively unclear.																																		
The bodies appear to be:																																		
"•	tabular or sheet-like in geometry;"																																		
"•	concordant and/or discordant to the gently east-dipping volcano-sedimentary strata;"																																		
"•	apparently elongate in the WNW-ESE direction, from magnetics."																																		
"The fundamental structural control is likely to be the large NNW (Huaca) fault system, strands of"																																		
"which bound the deposits on either side. Relative to this large structure, the deposits appear to be"																																		
"arranged in an en-echelon array, although this is not certain. The intersections of this major structure"																																		
"with the ENE-trending (Pista) faults, and perhaps a WNW-trending structural grain, are likely to"																																		
"have been important factors. In the current interpretation, the coincidence between replacive"																																		
magnetite and sulphide breccias and possibly early (now partially replaced) ocoite dykes with the																																		
fault zone in PPD001 and DDH04-21 appear to confirm the relation between the WNW faults and																																		
"mineralisation. However, without reliable kinematic data from the faults it is difficult to assess the"																																		
"absolute control on these deposits. Moreover, it is clear that the faults have had a protracted"																																		
displacement history due to the various tectonic phases that have affected the central Andean margin.																																		
"Therefore, unravelling the detailed structural controls may be complex."																																		
"9	Conclusions and Recommendations"																																		
"From the current desk top study carried out on the Pampa de Pongo data, the following conclusions"																																		
are drawn:																																		
"•	Fe-mineralisation is hosted by the regional-scale NNW-trending Huaca fault system. In the"																																		
"Pampa de Pongo area, this fault zone is intersected by ENE-trending faults (Repiticion) and"																																		
a WNW structural grain. The deposit is therefore expected to be affected by numerous brittle																																		
"fault structures, including some large fault zones."																																		
"•	Examination of photographs of diamond drillcore indicates that significant numbers of brittle"																																		
structures with post-mineralisation movement histories affect the Pampa de Pongo area. The																																		
cores are affected by numerous broken and gougey zones associated with steeply-dipping																																		
slip surfaces.																																		
"•	Fault kinematics have been reported elsewhere in the Marcona District but have yet to be"																																		
validated in the current project area. Knowledge of fault kinematics can be used to predict																																		
the likely geometries and help constrain models to guide further drill definition.

"•	A simple geometrical fault model based on structures logged from drilling, interpreted"																																		
magnetic maps and 3D inversion models has been interpreted to account for the apparent																																		
discontinuities in the subsurface geology.																																		
"•	The fault model is very tentative due to the scarcity of data and lack of dip information."																																		
These uncertainties can be extended to the shapes of the individual deposits.																																		
"•	Total Magnetic Intensity maps of the Pampa de Pongo Fe deposits gives a good"																																		
"representation of the plan view position of the mineralisation. However, inversion models"																																		
"should be used with caution in interpreting the 3D geology as they are inevitably simplified,"																																		
non-unique solutions.																																		
The following recommendations are made to assist Cardero in their further exploration and definition																																		
program of the Pampa de Pongo Fe project:																																		
"•	As bulk mining methods (e.g. caving) are particularly sensitive to the presence of major"																																		
"structures and are being considered for the Pampa de Pongo deposits, it is recommended that"																																		
Cardero put particular effort into constructing a robust fault model. The following																																		
procedures are recommended:																																		
o Use of structural measurements from oriented core and retrieval of well-preserved																																		
core using triple tube core barrels.																																		
o Inclined drilling for oriented core is recommended at high angles to the fault system																																		
orientations. Two orthogonal drill directions are recommended: 140°-320° and 050°-																																		
"230°, although no preferred drilling azimuth along these lines can be strongly"																																		
recommended based on the current study.																																		
o Systematic description of fault structures (outlined in SRK’s fault logging																																		
guidelines).																																		
"•	Uncertainty in the geometry of the deposits may be improved by collecting orientations of"																																		
"(relict) bedding together with the identification of marker horizons, if at all possible. Seeking"																																		
assistance from local academics or survey staff to try to place boundaries on the formations																																		
being drilled may also help.																																		
"•	The timing and geometry of the ocoite sills and dykes are an important part of understanding"																																		
the geological model and in determining the anticipated dilution of the various Fe bodies.																																		
"Measurements of all intrusive ocoite contacts, particularly in moderately inclined drillholes"																																		
"will greatly help to assess the presence or absence of steep ocoite dykes, which are otherwise"																																		
unconfirmed but suspected.
