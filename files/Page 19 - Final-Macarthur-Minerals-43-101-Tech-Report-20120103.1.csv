"1	SUMMARY"													
"1.1	Project"													
The Ularring Hematite Project (the Project) is located about 450 km east-northeast of the coastal													
"city of Perth, Western Australia. Its contiguous tenements cover a total area of 1,370 km2. The"													
conceptual scope for the Project is for a 2 Million tonne per annum (Mtpa) Potential Direct													
"Shipping Ore (DSO) operation starting 2013, with an operating life of over 5 years. The Project"													
comprises at least 3 deposits south of Evanston Menzies Road spread linearly over a 30 km													
"distance running north south. The Ularring project area comprises 19 Exploration, 15 Mining and 3"													
"Prospecting Licenses which are all held by Macarthur Iron Ore Pty Ltd, a 100% owned subsidiary"													
of Macarthur Minerals Limited (Macarthur).													
"1.2	Company Strategy"													
Macarthur Minerals Limited (Macarthur) is a Canadian listed company that is transitioning													
from an exploration company to develop the hematite resources on the Macarthur tenements.													
To date Macarthur has delineated a hematite based resource of 8.6Mt Indicated and 15.8Mt Inferred													
(at 50%Fe cut-off grade). Macarthur has a separate project comprising of a 1.316 billion tonne													
magnetite resource (at a 15% Fe cut-off grade) on separate prospects which was the subject of a													
"technical report titled Moonshine and Moonshine North Prospects, Lake Giles Iron Project, Western"													
Australia NI43-101 Technical Report - Preliminary Assessment released on 25th March 2011.													
Macarthurs corporate strategy is to advance the development of the potential DSO hematite for													
export commencing Q1 2014.													
"1.3	Key Findings"													
"The preliminary assessment is preliminary in nature, and includes inferred resources that are"													
considered too speculative geologically to have the economic considerations applied to them that													
"would enable them to be categorized as mineral reserves, and there is no certainty that the"													
preliminary economic assessment will be realised. The technical and financial evaluations in the													
"Preliminary Economic Assessment have concluded that, whilst there are challenges in meeting"													
"the Projects key objectives, there appear to be no fatal flaws that have been identified at this"													
stage.													
Key outcomes from the study included:													
"	Project would be based on a capacity of 2 Mtpa commencing in 2014, with an"													
estimated minimum life of five years;													
"	close proximity of existing infrastructure to support haulage of product to the Port of"													
Esperance;													
"	although the Preliminary Economic Assessment was limited to a potential DSO product,"													
metallurgical test work indicated that a beneficiated product was possible;													
"	positive financial outcome; and"													
"	strong potential for additional mineral resources."													
Issues identified from the Study include:													
"	requirement to improve mineral resources and mineral resource definition to indicated"													
mineral resources for the Preliminary Feasibility Study (PFS);													
"	establishment of sources of water for production and dust suppression purposes;"													
Jan-12													
Page 18 of 180													
Runge Limited													
"	development of the Port of Esperance expansion;"													
"	upgraded rail infrastructure and"													
"	obtaining key environmental approvals"													
"Based on the favourable outcomes indicated above, it is recommended the Project proceed to the"													
Preliminary Feasibility Study (PFS) phase.													
The following key activities are recommended to be undertaken throughout the PFS stage of the													
Project:													
"	further drilling to improve the mineral resource estimate;"													
"	establishing sources of water for production and dust suppression purposes;"													
"	further investigation into beneficiation potential;"													
"	development of mine and infrastructure design; and"													
"	refinement on capital and operating cost estimates (± 20-25%). A"													
summary of these key findings is described below.													
"Note: Sections 16-22 of this report are based on analysis of the Snark, Drabble Downs, Banjo-"													
Lost World and Central deposits. Disclosure contained in the reminder of the report includes													
disclosure with respect to all of these deposits and the Moonshine deposit.													
"1.4	Mineral Resource Definition"													
CSA Globals goethite/hematite Mineral Resource estimate from December 2010 for Banjo-Lost													
World and Central and from September 2011 for Snark and Drabble Downs is shown below in Table													
1													
Note: The CSA Mineral Resource was estimated within constraining wireframe solids based on a													
lower cut-off grade of 50% Fe. The resource is quoted from blocks above the specified Fe% cut-													
off grade. Differences may occur due to rounding.

"1.5	Metallurgical Test Work"													
A test work program was completed on Banjo in October 2010 and a separate test work program													
was completed on Snark in October 2011 which investigated high grade material at 55% Fe cut													
off and low grade material at 50% Fe to 55% Fe.													
No mineralisation type tested showed any issue with a crushing and screening operation. The													
"mineralisation appears to be friable and easily crushed, even when using equipment such as"													
sizers etc. Any modern crushing technology would be capable of crushing the material. The													
standard supply of motors for the equipment nominated for processing would be suitable to treat													
this ore.													
The Snark mineralisation did not show a propensity to develop a high quality lump product so is													
best considered to be an all fines Direct Shipping Ore (DSO). The Banjo mineralisation was of													
lower grade and produced a low grade lump and marginal fines grade products. Again this													
deposit is best considered as an all fines DSO. The results of the DSO drop tower testwork are													
shown in Table 2 below.													
Table 2. High Grade Composite Lump and Fines Results Summary													
Product	Mass	Fe	SiO2	Al2O3	P	S	LOI-1000	CaFe

Fines	64.2	58.9	5.5	3.04	0.081	0.132	6.8	63.2					
Feed	100	59.4	4.8	2.7	0.089	0.131	7.2	64

Feed	100	57.2	6.6	3.8	0.06	0.12	7.1	61.5					
"The low grade sample was crushed to -8 mm, screened into size fractions and assayed. There was"													
little variation in the assays by size showing that removing a low grade stream would not benefit this													
sample. Again this shows the mineralisation is not that of a typical Banded Ironstone Formation													
(BIF) (which usually concentrates impurities to the fines fractions).													
The low grade composite was tested to assess gravity based processing of the sized material.													
These tests involved both jigging and shaking table test work. The gravity concentration													
products were assessed to produce a 60% CaFe grade concentrate. The low grade composite test													
work results indicate that by combining the three products of the various gravity beneficiation													
methods a recovery by mass of 50% at a 60% CaFe grade could be achieved.													
The lower sulphur grade of the coarse jig mediates the higher sulphur grade of the fine jig and													
table. As the final beneficiated products sulphur grade is close to the conventional benchmark													
careful mining and/or blending should be utilised to maintain grade quality.													
The test work results show that a beneficiation program could be technically feasible for the low													
grade mineralisation. The scope of the Ularring Project is currently limited to the potential DSO													
product but the beneficiated mineralisation test work indicates that there may be a future													
opportunity to expand the Project to include the low grade mineralisation.

"1.6	Mining and Processing"													
"Mining of the Ularring Project would be conducted by conventional drill, blast, load and haul mining"													
methods. Ore would then be hauled to the Run of Mine (ROM) pad for crushing and screening. For													
drilling and blasting bench heights would be optimised to suit the drill rig. Explosives used in													
blasting operations would require storage in on-site magazines.													
Anticipated mineable pit tonnages are:

Central	2.1	55.7	60.6	7.1	3.4:1								
Total	10.5	55.9	60.5	29.8	2.8:1								
Note *: These figures are conceptual in nature based on a high percentage of inferred resources													
and so cannot be considered to be reserves. No guarantee can be given that such quantities could													
be mined.													
"At mine commencement, production rates, nominally 2 Mtpa of fines product, would be achieved"													
utilising contract mining and an owner operated mobile crushing and screening plant to feed the													
"DSO road train loading bin, with provision for emergency loadout via a mobile stacker to an"													
emergency product stockpile.													
"The key components including the crushers and screens would typically be skid, track or trailer"													
"mounted to allow haulage to site via low loaders for setting onto prepared concrete footings, where"													
"required, and to allow moving the plant to a secondary site as the mining operation develops."													
"1.7	Logistics"													
Initial analysis of the logistics options investigated involved a high level cost comparison. Some of													
the options investigated were dropped from further consideration during this early analysis due to													
their economic viability. Based on the selection of Port of Esperance the number of proposed													
routes was reduced to two: a private haul route and a public haul route. Financial analysis in													
previous study work reduced this to one preferred route.													
One aim of the selected haul route was to maximise the use of existing infrastructure from mine													
site to rail siding . The road route:													
"	utilises the existing Evanston Menzies Rd to Menzies,"													
"	bypassing the township of Menzies using the existing Intermin Resources haul road, and"													
"	then travels south on the Goldfields Highway to the proposed rail siding."													
The overall length of the road route from Snark Mining Operations Centre (MOC) to the rail siding is													
about 120 km and from Central MOC to the rail siding is 140 km. The road route would be suitable for													
up to 120 t payload road trains. For the purpose of this Study it is assumed that 115 t payload road													
trains would be used based on indicative pricing and information from the Toll Group.

The proposed rail siding is located within tenement Treppo Grande Iron P29/1895													
approximately 8.5 km south of Menzies which straddles the Menzies to Kalgoorlie rail line. A													
front end loader (Cat 988 or equivalent) would transfer the material from the stockpile onto the													
train. Each loaded wagon would be weighed by a track mounted strain gauge weighbridge on the													
"outward bound track. Once the train was fully loaded, it would await direction from central train"													
control to leave the siding and travel to the port.													
The 510 km of rail between Menzies South and Esperance is standard gauge. The rail siding													
lengths between Kalgoorlie and Esperance have recently been upgraded to allow train lengths													
"of 159 wagons. At 71.2 t per wagon the total tonnage that could be hauled by rail is 11,320 t per"													
consist.													
Advice from Brookfield Rail (the rail infrastructure provider) is that timing issues and the													
need for rail infrastructure upgrades to meet these proposed freight volumes is a little difficult to													
"determine at this stage. Brookfield is currently undertaking demand analysis in the Yilgarn region,"													
focussing on the Yilgarn iron mineralisation projects. Brookfield intends to develop a holistic													
approach to the rail expansion required to support these projects and to align with the proposed													
expansion at the Port of Esperance.													
"1.8	Port"													
The Project is centrally located between a large number of ports in Western Australias South													
West. Early analysis identified that port options had a development timeframe that did not suit this													
Project. The preferred port is the Port of Esperance operated by Esperance Ports Sea and Land													
(EPSL).													
"The Port of Esperance is the deepest port in southern Australia, capable of handling Cape Class"													
"vessels up to 200,000 tonnes and Panamax class vessels up to 75,000 tonnes. Esperance Port currently"													
exports 9 Mtpa of iron ore.													
"The Minister for Transport, Hon. Troy Buswell approved in principle an expansion to the Esperance"													
Port. This proposed expansion follows on from the $120 million transport corridor currently being													
constructed.													
Macarthur has entered into a legally binding Multi User Iron Ore Facility Access Deed with the													
"Esperance Port Authority, securing a commitment to a 2 Mtpa allocation as part of the proposed"													
expansion of the iron ore export facilities at the Port.													
"1.9	Infrastructure"													
The Project is proposing a staged development with the Snark and Drabble Downs deposits mined first													
then the mining operations and supporting infrastructure moving south in support of the Central and													
Banjo-Lost Worlds deposits.													
The location proposed for the Snark Mining Operations Centre (MOC) would be 1 to 2 km south of													
the Evanston Menzies road and within 2 km of the Snark deposit. An additional MOC has been													
estimated approximately 2km from the additional mining areas. Work is required in further studies													
to validate the MOC locations. Macarthurs capital expenditure required for the Project would be													
minimised through the reduction of Macarthur onsite infrastructure by means of contract mining and													
contract roadtrain haulage operations. It could be expected that the respective contractors would													
"provide their own maintenance facilities, administration supervision offices, warehouse and store"													
facilities for the duration of the Project.													
Jan-12													
Page 22 of 180													
Runge Limited													
The proposed accommodation camp location is approximately 1.2 km south east of the													
proposed Snark MOC location and about 1.5 km south of Evanston Menzies road. The same													
camp could be expanded to provide accommodation for the proposed future magnetite													
operation.													
Expanding the existing exploration camp was reviewed but was considered non-viable as its													
"location would be very close to the Snark deposit, however expansion of the existing exploration"													
camp would be utilised as a temporary solution to accommodate the early and peak construction													
workforce.													
"1.10	Environmental Assessment"													
"1.10.1	Flora"													
A Level 1 flora and vegetation survey has been conducted across eight exploration prospects													
"in the greater Macarthur tenement area, including the Central and Snark deposits and a Desktop"													
Study of the flora and vegetation has been conducted across the entire greater Macarthur tenement													
area. These studies identified flora species and vegetation communities of interest occuring													
"within the greater Macarthur tenement area. Subsequently, a targeted flora assessment and Level 2"													
flora and vegetation surveys were commissioned for 2011 for the proposed the Project with													
Autumn surveys completed in May 2011 and Spring surveys in September 2011.													
Numerous plant taxa and vegetation communities were recorded within the survey area and preliminary													
results suggest that the vegetation communities and flora recorded are widespread and typical													
of the greater area. Final Level 2 survey reports are due for completion in late 2011 and therefore													
limited data was available at the time of writing this report.													
"Based on existing knowledge from completed surveys, no Declared Threatened Flora (DRF)"													
species have been identified within the survey area. Up to seven Priority Flora species have													
been recorded within the survey area. Further investigations into the distribution and sizes of													
these populations were undertaken as part of the 2011 Spring Level 2 flora and vegetation survey													
to determine if the Priority Flora species are locally significant or more widespread taxa.													
No Threatened Ecological Communities (TECs) are known to occur in the greater Macarthur													
tenement area. Eleven Priority Ecological Communities (PECs) have been recorded within and													
"near the greater Macarthur tenement area. Currently, no PECs have been identified within the"													
Project area.													
"1.10.2	Fauna"													
Terrestrial													
A desktop assessment by Outback Ecology 2010 identified that fauna habitat and conservation													
fauna species of interest potentially occur within the greater Macarthur tenement area. Therefore													
Level 2 fauna surveys were proposed and an Autumn survey was conducted over the Snark													
"deposit, Snark Mining Operations Centre (MOC) and accommodation camp site in May 2011."													
"Excluding the possibilities for an un-identified bat species, no mammals or reptiles of"													
conservation significance were recorded during the survey. Two birds of conservation													
significance were recorded in the survey area. These are both listed as Priority fauna species													
under Department of Environment and Conservations (DEC) Priority Fauna List. Fauna listed as													
Priority fauna species have a moderate level of conservation and represent a limited risk to													
development which could be typically ameliorated through management practices.													
Jan-12													
Page 23 of 180													
Runge Limited													
"While the removal of native vegetation for the Project would cause minor impacts on fauna, the"													
vegetation is not considered to be significant habitat for fauna indigenous to Western Australia.													
Level 2 surveys for the remainder of the Project area are ongoing and due for completion in 2012.													
Malleefowl1 are protected under Commonwealth and State legislation. They are listed as Vulnerable													
under the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation 1999 (EPBC) Act and are a													
Schedule 1 species under the Wildlife Conservation Act 1950(WC). Malleefowls are known to													
occur within the greater Macarthur tenement area based on recorded observations of both													
Malleefowls and breeding mounds by exploration staff and subcontractors. A targeted survey for the													
Malleefowl across portions of the proposed Project area was conducted in July and August 2011 to													
identify potentially active breeding mounds that may be impacted by the Project and to assess the													
risk to local Malleefowl populations as a result of the Project.													
"Preliminary results of the targeted survey include the observation of two birds, evidence of various"													
"types of local activity such as scratchings and scats, and over 50 breeding mounds (classified as either"													
"extinct, inactive and potentially active) within the survey area. Only one mound in the area around the"													
"Snark deposit, MOC and accommodation camp site was classified as potentially active1. Within"													
"the Central Prospect area, four potentially active mounds were observed. Additional Malleefowl"													
targeted surveys for the remainder of the Project area are planned for 2012.													
Short Range Endemics (SRE)													
"Preliminary survey results suggest that, based on the latest survey results and species observation"													
"work, SRE species may be present in the Project area. Consultation with the Environmental"													
Protection Authority (EPA) and DEC would be undertaken to determine if additional SRE													
surveys are required to further understand the extent of these species.													
Subterranean Fauna													
"A subterranean fauna pilot study conducted in early 2011, identified that potential habitat for"													
subterranean fauna occurs within the greater Macarthur tenement area including the Project area.													
Additional subterranean fauna surveys were commissioned in 2011 across the Project area to													
expand on the existing data.													
Preliminary results suggest that no troglofauna species are restricted to the Project area. Results													
suggest the troglofauna community within the greater Macarthur tenement area is generally severely													
diminished and may be of low to moderate diversity by Yilgarn region standards.													
No stygofauna data in addition to the pilot study was available at the time of preparing this report.													
"The first round of stygofauna sampling was conducted during August 2011, with a second round of"													
sampling proposed.													
"1.11	Approvals"													
"Regulatory agencies including the Department of Mines and Petroleum (DMP), Environment"													
"Protection Authority (EPA), Department of Water (DoW) and Department of Environment and"													
1 A potentially active Malleefowl breeding mound is defined as a mound that still retains the shape and structure of a typical Malleefowl													
mound and has the potential to be actively used by a Malleefowl for breeding purposes during the next or future breeding season

Conservation (DEC) operate under numerous Acts and Memoranda of Understanding (MOU).													
Each agency has its own environmental impact assessment requirements.													
The primary legislation for environmental protection in Western Australia is the													
Environmental Protection Act 1986 (WA) (EP Act). It is administered on behalf of the Minister													
for the Environment by the DEC and takes precedence over the Mining Act 1978 (WA) (Mining													
Act). The Mining Act is used to regulate mining activities in Western Australia. Other key													
"state legislation includes the Wildlife Conservation Act 1950 (WA) (WC Act), Aboriginal"													
"Heritage Act 1972 (WA) (AH Act), Rights in Water and Irrigation Act 1914 (WA) (RIWI Act) and"													
Country Areas Water Supply Act 1947 (WA) (CAWS Act).													
"The main Act that governs environmental protection at the Federal level is the EPBC Act, which is"													
the Australian Government's central piece of environmental legislation. It provides a legal													
"framework to protect and manage nationally and internationally important flora, fauna, ecological"													
communities and heritage places - defined in the EPBC Act as Matters of National Environmental													
Significance (NES).													
A number of secondary approvals have been detailed in Section 11.0 of this Study Report.													
"1.12	Native Title"													
There are currently no registered native title claims over the Project area. There are currently no													
registered native title claimant groups in the project area.													
"A search of the Department of Indigenous Affairs (DIA), Aboriginal Heritage Inquiry System confirms"													
that there are no registered heritage sites on any of the tenements within the Project area (DIA													
2011).													
A heritage survey is currently being conducted in accordance with EPA Guidance Statement													
No. 41 (EPA 2004a) across the greater Macarthur tenement area involving both archaeological and													
ethnographical surveys. Seven potential archaeological sites have been identified within and													
"surrounding the Project area (Glendenning W [Warranup Pty Ltd] 2011, pers comm. 7 October)."													
Traditional Owner Group representatives would be invited on site to assess the significance of													
these archaeological sites to assist with the consultation process going forward if disturbance of													
these sites is proposed.													
Macarthur will work towards mutually beneficial outcomes through a commitment to community													
consultation and ongoing liaison. Macarthur facilitates local direct employment and indirect													
"employment, endeavour to support training and development initiatives related to exploration,"													
"future mining and ancillary services. Macarthur respects cultural diversity, connection to country"													
and encourages sustainable business relationships.													
"1.13	Capex"													
The capital expenditure estimate (CAPEX) for the project is:													
Table 4 Capital Cost Estimate Summary													
	Costs (AU$m)												
Direct	93.5												
Jan-12													
Page 25 of 180													
Runge Limited													
Indirect	16.8												
Contingency	23.4												
Total	133.7												
"This capital estimate covers the mine, mine operations centre, internal roads, plant, camp, haul road"													
and rail siding. No capital component is included for the upgrade to existing rail and port													
infrastructure as these are paid to the suppliers as operating costs.													
"1.14	Opex"													
The following Table 5 summarises the operating costs (dry):													
Table 5 Operating Cost Estimate Summary

Processing	2.5												
Road Haulage	14.4												
Rail Haulage	26.3												
Port	8												
Indirects	2												
Total	67.3												
These slightly higher than normal operating costs are as a result of the long haul distances (121 to													
137km road and 510km rail) and the capital surcharge components for the upgrades to the													
existing rail and port infrastructure.

"	First mineralisation on ship 2014."													
"1.17	Preliminary Economic Assessment Assumptions"													
The economic analysis is based on mineral resources that are not mineral reserves and as such cannot													
demonstrate economic viability.													
The following assumptions were made in the development of this Preliminary Economic													
Assessment:													
"	for the purposes of the Preliminary Economic Assessment the minable quantity includes the"													
Indicated and Inferred Resources that are too speculative for reserve estimation ;													
"	the conversion of the resources to the minable quantity was based on a whittle optimization"													
process and then adopting a strip ratio based on a typical pit design;													
"	the port expansion project would be completed in time to support the Project;"													
"	the rail expansion project would be completed in time to support the Project;"													
"	the Central and Banjo deposits have similar metallurgical and geotechnical"													
parameters as Snark based on the project geologists assessment that the deposits have													
similar genesis and structure;													
"	water of sufficient quality and quantity would be sourced local to the Project area;"													
"	the final ROM pads are assumed to be located approximately 2 km from the mining pits;"													
"	the final product is acceptable to the market;"													
"	Intermin Resources would allow Macarthur to use its haul road to bypass the township"													
of Menzies;													
"	negotiation with Main Roads Western Australia (MRWA) would result in Macarthur being"													
able to construct a new Goldfields Hwy intersection and close the existing Yundagga Rd													
intersection;													
"	sufficient storage would be available at the port as a result of the proposed expansion"													
to provide sufficient storage for Macarthur to support export by Cape sized vessels;													
"	the capital outlay required to upgrade the existing rail from Menzies to Esperance to support"													
an additional 2 Mtpa would be no more than $10 million;													
"	the capital outlay required to upgrade the existing Esperance Port to support an additional"													
10 Mtpa would be no more than $185 million; and													
"	the impact of the MRRT and the Carbon tax has not been taken into account."

"The Ularring project area comprises 19 Exploration, 15 Mining and 3 Prospecting Licenses which are"													
"all held by Macarthur Iron Ore Pty Ltd, a 100% owned subsidiary of Macarthur Minerals Limited"													
"(Macarthur). The Ularring tenements are centred on approximately 6,683,000mN and 788,300mE"													
which is equivalent to 29° 57S latitude and 119° 59? longitude. The Ularring Hematite Project													
"includes five individual prospects, being the Snark, Drabble Downs, Central, Banjo and Lost World"													
"prospects. Details of the licenses for each prospect, including area and annual expenditure"													
"commitments, are shown in Figure 4-2, Figure 4-3, Figure 4-4 and Figure 4-5."													
The boundaries of Exploration Licenses are defined by graticular sections representing blocks													
equivalent to one minute of latitude and one minute of longitude with an approximate area of 285													
"hectares. The locations of Exploration License boundaries are specified in lease applications, but"													
lease boundaries are not physically marked on the ground. Mining License boundaries are defined by													
the location of corner claim pegs with approximate coordinates based on GPS readings recorded in													
claim documentation.

"The Ularring Hematite Project also includes a proposed rail siding, some 105km to the east of the"													
project. The proposed rail siding is located within tenement P29/1895 approximately 8.5 km south of													
Menzies sitting over the Menzies to Kalgoorlie rail line. The tenement is held by Treppo Grande Iron													
Pty Ltd (Treppo). Salmon River Resources Limited exercised an option to acquire 100% of the													
"private Australia company, Treppo and its 100% interest in tenement licences and tenement licence"													
applications on 15 th December 2011. A formal written agreement is expected to be in place by the													
completion of the Preliminary Feasibility Study.

"5	ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE AND"													
PHYSIOGRAPHY													
"5.1	Topography, Elevation and Vegetation"													
The topography of the Project area is comprised of low ridges associated with the Banded Iron Formation													
"(BIF) units, striking in a general northwest - southeast direction, that rise up from the surrounding sandy"													
plains. The area is at an elevation of between 400m and 520m above sea level. The vegetation of the													
project area is dominated by mulga scrub with local patches of low to medium eucalyptus woodland and													
areas of salt tolerant shrub and spinifex.													
"5.2	Access"													
The Project can be accessed from Kalgoorlie via the sealed Menzies Highway north for 130													
"kilometres, then west from the town of Menzies for 115 kilometres along the unsealed graded"													
"Diemals road. Alternatively the project can be accessed from Perth, via sealed roads to Southern"													
"Cross and Bullfinch, then north and east for 200 kilometres along the Diemals road. Kalgoorlie is"													
serviced by daily commercial flights from Perth. Access within the project area is by a number of													
"tracks cleared by previous explorers, and more recently by Macarthur. These tracks may become"													
impassable after heavy rain.													
"5.3	Climate"													
The climate at the Macarthur Hematite Project is characterised as a semi-arid climate. The Diemals weather													
"station, located to the west of the project at Latitude 29.67° S, Longitude 119.30?, was operated by the"													
"Australian Bureau of Meteorology between 1970 and 1994 (Australian Bureau of Meteorology, 2011)."													
Diemals recorded a mean annual rainfall of 275.7mm with rain fall mostly in the winter months. The													
"temperature averages over 40°C for 15 days in the summer months, from November to March, while in the"													
"winter months, from June to August, the temperature averages a minimum range from 3.9°C to 5.0°C. See"													
Figure 5-1 for more details.													
The climate at the Project area allows an operating season covering the full length of the year. In the													
"Kalgoorlie region, mining and exploration activities are conducted throughout the year, with infrequent"													
generally short disruptions during and after periods of heavy rain.

"6	HISTORY"													
"6.1	Property Ownership"													
Since the late 1960's several exploration companies have held the exploration rights to the Project													
"tenements. There have been 3 main phases of exploration; nickel exploration from 1968 to 1972, gold"													
exploration from 1993 to 2004 and more recently iron ore exploration. The following summary has been													
"derived from Revell (2006), Farmer (1997a, 1998a, 1998c) and Busbridge (1998a, 1998b)."													
The Ularring Project was formally known as the Lake Giles Hematite Project.													
"6.2	Project Results - Previous Owners"													
"6.2.1	Nickel"													
"Nickel exploration occurred from 1968 up to 1972, primarily for nickel sulphide mineralisation. During this"													
"period the Project tenements were held by Amax Australia Inc, Consolidated Goldfields Australia Limited,"													
"Geotechnics Pty Ltd (Geotechnics) on behalf of Welcome Stranger Mining Company Limited, Kia Ora"													
"Gold Corp, Delta Minerals NL and Le Nickel Exploration Pty Ltd."													
"During this period geological mapping, rock chip sampling, geophysical surveys including magnetic,"													
electromagnetic and induced polarization were undertaken (Ward et al 1970).													
Geotechnics was the only company to drill in the area during this period. Table 8 summarises the drilling													
"completed by Geotechnics, however the grid that Geotechnics used has not been re-established and the"													
exact location of the drill holes is unknown.													
"Table 8 Summary of the drilling 1968 to 1972 (modified from Ward 1970a, 1970b, 1970c)"

"6.2.2	Gold"													
From 1993 to 1998 several companies explored the area for gold mineralisation.													
In May 1993 Battle Mountain Australia Incorporated (Battle Mountain) was granted the tenement E30/93													
"which partly overlies the tenement E30/240, which is part of the Project area (Famer 1997a, 1998a, 1998c)."													
Battle Mountain established a grid over E30/40 from which the company collected 37 rock chip samples													
"and completed a soil 50m x 500m sample program, which the company subsequently infilled to a 50 x 100"													
"metre spacing for a total of 1,175 samples. This soil sample program identified several gold anomalous"													
zones with maximum grades of 3 to 12 ppb gold (Anon 1994).													
"In August 1993, Aztec Mining Company Limited (Aztec) was granted the E30/100 lease which is"													
immediately west of the project tenements and in December 1993 Aztec was granted tenement E30/99 (now													
"covered by tenements M30/213-218). Aztec collected 715 soil samples, 31 stream sediment samples and"													
auger samples which identified several anonymous gold zones that peaked at 53ppb. Aztec drilled 80 RAB													
"holes (Table 9) to test the anomalous gold zones, which returned weak mineralisation, with the best result"													
"being from drill hole DON06 for 25 meters at 0.4 g/t (Smith el at 1995, Busbridge 1998b)."													
Jan-12													
Page 38 of 180													
Runge Limited													
"Battle Mountain drilled 41 RAB drill holes (Table 9) in 1994/5, targeting the anomalies identified in the soil"													
sampling. These anomalies were named Soapbox and Enfield prospects in tenement E30/99. The best result													
from the RAB drill holes was from DOP8 for 4m @ 0.4 g/t at the Soapbox prospect (Anon 1995).													
"In 1995 Noble Resources NL (Noble) formed a joint venture with Battle Mountain to explore E30/93,"													
"however Noble interest was transferred to Barclay Holdings Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Titan"													
"Resources NL (Titan), in February 1997."													
Titan commissioned Telsa Airborne Geophysics in 1997 to complete an airborne geophysics survey of the													
"tenements E30/93, E30/93 and E30/100. The airborne survey included magnetics and radiometric surveys"													
and was flown at a height of 50 meters on 100 meter line spacing. In the same year Titan completed a 537													
"soil auger program over the tenement E30/93. (Famer 1997a, 1997b 1998a)."													
"In early 1998 Titan collected 311 meter soil samples on a 50 x 80 meter grid within tenement E30/99, but"													
"failed to define any anonymous gold zones (Busbridge 1998a). Mid 1998, Titan commissioned G&D"													
Drilling to undertake a vacuum drilling program on tenement E30/100. The drill holes went down to a													
"maximum depth of 1.5 meters and a total of 1,275 samples were collected on a drill spacing of 100m x"													
400m. In December 1998 Titan withdrew from the joint venture and Noble surrendered the tenement													
(Busbridge 1998a).													
From Late 1998 to 2003 Mr Troy Dalla-Costa was granted a number of tenements which were to become													
the Macarthur Project area.

"6.2.3	Iron Ore"													
Geotechnics conducted some rock chip sampling of the BIF units prior to 1972 for iron ore mineralisation.													
Results included 36.1% Fe and 63.5% Fe; however these were not followed up. No exploration targeted													
iron ore mineralisation until Internickel Australia Pty Ltd (Internickel) started exploring the tenements.													
Macarthur - Iron Ore Pty Ltd (MIO) purchased the project tenements from Mr Troy Dalla-Costa in 2003													
and then MIO was purchased by Adex Holdings Limited (Adex) in 2004. Adex changed its name to													
Internickel Australia Pty Ltd (Internickel) in 2004 and Macarthur purchased the project tenements in 2005.													
In 2011 Internickel changed its name to MIO.													
Macarthur has explored the Project tenements for iron ore since 2005 and has completed geological													
"mapping surveys, geophysical surveys, auger sampling of the pisolite targets and reverse circulation (RC)"													
"and diamond drilling(DD) of the magnetite ore targets (Revell 2006, Fox 2001, Fox 2002 and Fox 2003)."													
"To date Macarthur has drilled 1,430 RC and 40 DD holes for 121,913m and 2,576.95m respectively as part"													
of the Ularring Iron Ore Project.													
"6.3	Historical Mineral Production"

"7	GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND MINERALIZATION"													
"7.1	Regional Geology"													
The Project covers most of the Yerilgee Greenstone Belt which is up to 60 kilometres in length within the													
Southern Cross Province of the Yilgarn Craton. The Yilgarn Craton consists of the lenticular greenstone													
belts surrounded by partly foliated gneissic granitoids.													
"The greenstone belts consist of metamorphosed ultramafic, mafic and sediments, including BIF which are"													
"Archaean in age and are commonly intruded by mafic, intermediate and granitic rocks."													
The greenstone belts are generally metamorphosed to mid greenschist facies towards the central parts of the													
belt and lower amphibolite facies on the edges of the belt where they are in contact with the granitoids.													
"The greenstone belts are highly deformed, faulted and folded. Four deformation events are recognised"													
regionally throughout the Yilgarn Craton:													
"	D1 - movement along the south-north direction"													
"	D2 and D3 - shortening and shear movements in the ENE-WSW compression direction"													
"	D4 - Lateral extension of the greenstone belt in a NNW-SSE direction"													
"Figure7-1 shows the regional geology of the Macarthur area and its surrounding, derived from Geological"													
Survey of Western Australia (GSWA) (2011).

"7.2	Local Geology"													
The parts of the north-northwest trending Yerilgee greenstone belt covered by the project tenements are													
underlain by a layered succession of Archaean rocks. At the interpreted base of the succession is a sequence													
of high-magnesium basalt flows more than one kilometre thick overlain by komatiitic ultramafic volcanic													
rocks with narrow interflow BIFs and in some cases other sedimentary rocks. Further high-magnesium													
"basalt lavas with occasional interflow BIFs overlain, possibly unconformably by sedimentary rocks (cherty,"													
"silicified, pyritic and graphitic) are thought to form the top of this sequence. In places gabbroic sills have"													
been intruded into the lower mafic and ultramafic lavas. These are believed to be co-magmatic with the													
upper high-magnesium basalts. The elongated lens shaped Yerilgee belt is bounded by major north-													
northwest trending fault/shear zones.													
Jan-12													
Page 41 of 180													
Runge Limited													
The Archaean sequence has been intensely folded. At least five possibly sinistral fault zones of similar but													
slightly more north-westerly trend are interpreted within the widest part of the belt. These are believed to													
successively repeat the layered succession. Also two northerly trending sinistral faults obliquely crosscut the													
belt in this area.													
A number of large synclinal fold structures have been identified. These appear to be located adjacent to the													
eastern margins of the fault blocks. These folds have north-westerly and north-north-westerly trending axes													
"and where mapped in detail (Greenfield, 2001) show a plunge at 30° to 60° in the same direction. In general"													
"the fold axes are steeply dipping. The folding appears to have been contemporaneous with faulting. In plan,"													
the movement on the fault planes was sinistral but in a true sense is believed also to have been reverse													
faulting with the direction of movement on the western down-throw sides of the fault planes being inclined													
at 30° to 60° towards the east northeast. The synclines and anticlines are considered to be drag fold													
structures.													
The most recent notable tectonic event was approximately 2.6 billion years ago and appears to have dilated													
"the north-northwest trending shear zones, generated north-northeast trending and conjugate northeast to"													
easterly trending structures. These brittle factures have in many places been intruded by granitic dykes or													
quartz veins. The project tenements cover about 60 kilometres of the greenstone belts strike length but													
because of fault repeats are estimated to cover more than 100 kilometres of komatiite sequence strike length.													
"7.3	Property Geology"													
Figure 7-2 presents details of the outcropping geology of the Project. The outcropping geology of the													
"hematite areas are comprised of a combination of un-altered silica rich BIFs and altered, enriched"													
hematite/goethite (H/G) BIFs. The H/G units are the source of the companys H/G resources to date and													
exist largely as a supergene product. Weathering has resulted in the leaching of the majority of the silica													
"from the BIFs, thus producing a rock rich in iron and low in silica. These enriched bands vary from 1m to"													
30m in true thickness and are largely steeply dipping at 70o to 90o.													
"The Project area is comprised of multiple parallel bands of BIF, many of which are enriched, with varying"													
(1m to 30m) thicknesses. The strike of these bands is largely NW-SE. A number of folds with a NW plunge													
have been identified with further work into the structure of the deposit on-going. The strike extent of the													
main ridge line at Snark is 5.9km and the package consisting of the multiple BIF bands along with the inter-													
bedded ultramafics has a thickness of approximately 500m. The drill tested area at Drabble Downs consists													
of three main BIF ridges with a combined strike length of approximately 3.4km.													
At Central drill tested BIF ridges cover a combined strike extent of approximately 10.5km. As at Snark the													
"package consists of two main BIF ridges, each consisting of multiple parallel bands of BIF ranging from 1m"													
to 30m thickness. The total package thickness including inter-bedded mafics and ultramafics is over 1km.													
The same geological package is repeated at both Banjo / Lost World and at Moonshine. At Banjo / Lost													
World the total strike length is approximately 4.0km and at Moonshine the total strike length is 0.8km.													
"The mapped outcrops range from locally dark, rich and dense mineralized BIF (as shown in Figure 7-3 and"													
Figure 7-4); to porous and lateritic weathered BIF with locally enriched layers (as shown in Figure 7-5 to													
Figure 7-6). In RC chips the mineralized material is dusty and brown.													
"The appearance in many parts is unprepossessing, and the drill sample assays confirm that the grade is"													
averaging around 55% with local grades as 59% Fe. Hand specimens collected on surface tend to average													
"higher, over 60% probably as a result of visual grade biasing, and are not used for resource estimation."

"7.4	Weathering Profile"													
The rocks of the Project have been logged into six different weathering classifications:													
"	Complete - All clay with no remnant rock texture"													
"	Extreme - Largely clay with some remnant rock texture"													
"	Strong - Rock texture moderately preserved, significant presence of fines, often weak"													
"	Moderate - Rock texture fully preserved, all minerals show weathering"													
"	Partial - Oxidation limited to the most unstable minerals only (e.g. sulphides)"													
"	Fresh - No oxidation of any minerals"													
The majority of the H/G ore grade (>50%Fe) material is located within the Strong and Moderate													
classifications. The boundary between partial oxidation and fresh rock has been determined to be variable													
within this area with down hole (-60° dip) depths ranging from 30m to 100 m.													
"7.5	Water Table"													
The water table throughout the project area varies greatly in both level and salinity. The Snark area has been													
subject to a recent hydrological study and the water table has been interpreted to between 50m to 65m													
"below the surface, at an RL of 410m to 425m. This is largely considered to be below the base of H/G"													
mineralisation. With regards to salinity the ground water in the area has a TDS value that typically ranges													
"between 1,600 and 13,000 mg/L, which indicates a moderately brackish to saline classification (typical"													
"seawater is >35,000 mg/L)."

"8	DEPOSIT TYPES"													
"8.1	Mineralisation Styles"													
The mineralisation currently known at the Project comes in two forms:													
"	Magnetite - present in the fresh BIFs along with high quantities of silica. This is the primary"													
unaltered form of BIFs at site and in general has not been subject to any later iron enrichment.													
"	Hematite/Goethite (H/G) - present in the weathered BIFs with lower quantities of silica. Product of"													
"supergene enrichment of the BIFs, which results in the leaching of the silica from the primary fresh"													
BIFs. This results in elevated iron content in comparison.													
The focus of this document is the H/G style of mineralisation.													
"8.2	Conceptual Models"													
The H/G units are the source of the companys H/G resources to date and exist largely as a supergene													
"product. Weathering has resulted in the leaching of the majority of the silica from the BIFs, thus producing a"													
rock rich in iron and low in silica. These enriched bands vary from 1m to 30m in true thickness and are													
largely steeply dipping between 70o and 90o with variable dip directions dependent on the location within													
the deposit. The main units in Drabble Downs are generally shallower dipping (50o to 80o) to the south-west													
and appear to form the centre of the overall regional Snark fold sequence.

"9	EXPLORATION"													
Over the past two years Macarthur geologists have conducted ground traverses and geologically mapped the													
Macarthur prospects. The outcropping rock was classified as either BIF or H/G enriched BIF. The extent of													
"outcrops was surveyed by handheld Garmin GPS devices, with an accuracy of ± 3 metres on the GDA94"													
grid system. These boundaries were subsequently digitised in the MapInfo GIS software package. The													
location of outcrops and mapped structural information was used in planning the location and orientation of													
drill holes for Mineral Resource modelling.													
Outcrop maps with drill collars for the H/G project areas are presented in Figure 9-1 to Figure 9-3.

Results from drilling completed between 2009 and 2011 were included in this Mineral Resource estimate.													
"The database supporting the Mineral Resource estimate on which this study is based, includes all"													
"information collected up until 31st August 2011. As of this date there were 819 drill holes (807 RC, 11"													
"DDH) loaded in the database for 55,249.4m. Of this total, 29,990m from 819 holes were assayed, and"													
"verified for use in the Mineral Resource estimate. Table 10 and Table 11 present the drilling statistics,"													
supporting the Mineral Resource estimate.

All material obtained from the diamond holes were used for the metallurgical test work; therefore no													
"diamond core samples were assayed, but the logged geology was taken into account when modelling the"													
resources.													
Macarthur contracted Orbit Drilling Pty Ltd (Orbit Drilling) to carry out both the RC and diamond													
"drilling. Orbit Drilling are an exploration drilling company based in Perth, Western Australia. Two RC drill"													
"rigs were utilised in 2010 and 2011, a Schramm T660 (Volvo 8x4 wheel rig) and a track mounted Schramm"													
T450WS.

"Macarthur has a number of procedures in place, which have been designed to reduce the risk of errors from"													
"drilling, sampling and assaying processes. These processes along with the associated risk reduction"													
procedures are summarised below.													
Every hole drilled was planned and supervised by Macarthur geological staff. Holes were planned to													
"intercept the resource body in the most representative way possible considering terrain, outcropping geology"													
"and results from previous drilling. During drilling, a company geologist would supervise the work and log"													
the geology to each metre interval and end the hole at a certain depth based on the outcome of the drilling													
and the estimates provided by the planning.													
"Planned drill hole collar positions were marked by GPS, and if clearing was required to provide a suitable"													
"drill site, then planned collar positions were re-marked after clearing. To assist with drill rig alignment, two"													
sighter pegs were placed at appropriate distances from the collar position using a sighter compass. After													
"drilling, all drill holes included in the Mineral Resource estimates were surveyed by high accuracy Real"													
"Time Kinematic GPS (RTKGPS). RTKGPS surveys, which were undertaken by surveyors from Minecomp"													
Pty Ltd are accurate to within 50 millimetres in three dimensions.													
"After the drill rig set up on each hole, Macarthur staff checked hole inclinations with a clinometer. Holes"													
drilled in 2009 and 2010 field seasons were down-hole surveyed with a single shot down-hole camera													
lowered down the rod string. Holes drilled in 2011 (Snark and Drabble Downs) were surveyed with a													
GYRO tool.													
"Drill collar plans are presented in Figure 9-1 to Figure 9-3, and shows the locations of drill hole collars"													
superimposed on outcrop mapping. This demonstrates the number of ridges yet to be drill tested (as at the													
"31st August, date of database cut-off). It is important to note that some ridges have been assessed to be"													
made up of non-mineralised BIF and are not intended to be drilled.													
"Figure 10-1 to Figure10-3 present typical cross sections through the mineralisation, demonstrating the"													
"relationship between sample lengths and the true thickness of mineralisation, as well as the geological"													
orientation of the mineralisation.													
"The Qualified Person is not aware of any drilling, sampling or recovery factors that could materially impact"													
the accuracy and reliability of the results.

Drilling practices are focused on maximizing sample recovery and minimizing sample contamination. At													
"the end of each six metre drill rod, the drilling pauses and compressed air is blown through the rods to flush"													
"cuttings from the drill hole, the sample hoses and the cyclone to minimize sample contamination, and to"													
ensure that there are no blockages in the sample stream. The cyclone is regularly inspected and cleaned as													
necessary. Samples are collected over one metre down-hole intervals and a sub-sample collected in a calico													
bag by splitting through an industry standard three tier riffle splitter. A total of 75% of the sample passes													
"through the splitter to be captured in a residue bucket (Figure 11-4), whilst the remaining 25% of the sample"													
is evenly distributed through the primary sample chute and the field duplicate chute. The calico bag sub-													
samples are labelled with the drill hole number and depth range and placed on top of the remnant bulk													
"sample, which is placed in individual piles on the ground alongside the drill collar. All one metre samples"													
were submitted to the assay laboratory. Sample recovery is judged from the appearance and volume of the													
"primary sample, contained within its calico bag, and the remnant bulk sample."

"11	SAMPLING PREPARATION, ANALYSIS AND SECURITY"													
"11.1	Sample Preparation and Security"													
On completion of each hole the field assistants collect the samples and secure them in polyweave bags using													
"a cable tie labelled with a unique ID, which the lab would check upon receipt as a way of being aware of"													
tampering. The polyweave bags are securely stored in the Macarthur Iron Ore Project exploration camp													
"compound, where Macarthur personnel are located on a continual basis."													
The samples are transported to the assay laboratory depot in Kalgoorlie in a large bulka bag to avoid loss of													
"samples, prior to being dispatched to the assay laboratory in Perth using the Coastal Mid-West freight"													
company.													
"Drill samples were sent to Amdel - Ultratrace Assay Laboratories (Amdel), Perth. A flow chart"													
demonstrating sample preparation for all Macarthur samples is presented in Figure 11-1. The pulverised													
"residues were analysed by XRF. Amdel maintained sound security for all samples, from receipt of sample to"													
storage of crush and pulp residue (limited storage time). Assay results were emailed to Macarthur and CSA													
Database Management.													
"Amdel Laboratories, wholly owned by Bureau Veritas, are independent of Macarthur, and are ISO and"													
NATA Accredited. They are a member of ISO MN-002-02 Chemical Analysis Committee AQIS registered.

"Prior to May 2011, drill hole data was stored in a Microsoft Access database, maintained in Macarthurs"													
Perth office. Data tables were exported as comma separated text files (csv format) and imported into													
"Datamine. The Mineral Resource estimates for Central, Banjo, Lost World and Moonshine are based upon"													
data contained within this MS Access database. As of May 2011 all drill data was imported into the													
Datashed database.													
"11.3	Quality Assurance and Quality Control - 2011 Drilling"													
"11.3.1	Certified Reference Materials"													
Certified reference materials (CRMs) are packets of rock sample that have been ground to a size consistent													
"with the grind size used in commercial assay laboratories, typically 105 pm. A variety of CRM types exist,"													
and Macarthur chose the CRM type that most resembled the rock type that exists at the Macarthur Hematite													
Project. They are certified because the manufacturer of the CRM has independently tested the accuracy of													
"the expected mean grade of the sample through a series of round robin laboratory umpire testing, and"													
therefore certify the assay grade.													
"Macarthur purchased two CRM products from Geostats Pty Ltd, a supplier of reference material based in"													
"Perth, Western Australia. These are detailed in Table 12. CRMs were submitted with drill samples through"													
"the 2011 drill campaigns, and are detailed in Table 12. CRMs were inserted at the rate of one CRM every"													
"50m of sampling, with at least one per hole. The results of the CRM assays are presented in a time"													
"sequenced scatter plot, and show the actual assayed grade against the expected grade of the sample (Table"													
12) within acceptable tolerances. Macarthur has nominated a tolerance limit of ± 2 standard deviations; if													
the assayed CRM falls within these limits then the results of assays from samples submitted for XRF testing													
with that CRM are deemed to have passed. If the assayed value for the CRM falls outside the tolerance													
"limits, then the assayed CRM is deemed to have failed, which therefore casts doubt on the accuracy of the"													
assays for samples that were submitted with the CRM. In this case Macarthur have the option of re-assaying													
"a batch of samples, to ensure that the suite of assays received from the laboratory are as accurate as possible,"													
when compared to available checks and balances. The graphs also allow the monitoring of any drift in assay													
trends over time and thus provide information on analytical accuracy.													
The CRM plots for Fe (%) for both CRM types submitted to Amdel are presented in Figure 11-2 and Figure													
11-3.

"11.3.2	Field Duplicates"													
"Field duplicates are duplicate samples taken at the drill rig, in parallel to the primary sample that is"													
submitted for assay analysis. The purpose of a field duplicate is to test firstly the quality of the sample													
splitter on the drill rig; and secondly the quality of sample preparation at the assay laboratory. Figure 11-4													
"demonstrates the collection of a duplicate field sample, whereby the sample collected from the drill hole"													
"passes evenly through a three tiered riffle splitter, with equal portions of sample passing through to the"													
primary sample and field duplicate sample. The field duplicate sample is submitted to the assay laboratory													
at the same time as the primary sample. Macarthur captures a field duplicate sample at the 8m depth of													
"every hole, then every 25m beyond that depth, for each hole. When a field duplicate sample is not captured"													
"by calico bag, the sample stream from the duplicate chute is allowed to fall to the ground where it is"													
"discarded. The field duplicate calico bag is stored on the reject sample pile alongside the primary sample, as"													
demonstrated in Figure 11-5.

"Field duplicate results are presented in quantile - quantile (QQ) plots, as shown in Figure 11-6. The QQ plot"													
demonstrates that the sampling populations are very similar and that there are no overall significant issues													
with the sampling procedures in the field. The use of duplicate field samples provides information on the													
overall precision (repeatability) of the analytical results.

"11.3.3	Lab Pulp Duplicates"													
The assay laboratory independently tests its own analytical quality using internal laboratory control													
"procedures, one method of which is to submit a split of the 105?m sample for XRF analyses, sometime"													
after the original sample has been analysed. This is to test the accuracy of the XRF analyser. Assay results													
for iron ore samples are anticipated to be very similar due to the low nugget effect of the mineralisation.													
A scatter plot of primary pulp samples versus laboratory pulp samples for Fe% from Amdel is presented in													
Figure 11-7. This demonstrates a high level of accuracy.

The QAQC data provided up to December 2010 included a separate database table of 176 field duplicate													
"assays taken from the mineralized intercepts, and 623 laboratory repeat assays. The 176 field duplicates"													
taken from hole LGRC_223 to LGRC_470 were resolved to 169 paired assays. All were of mineralized													
"hematite-goethite intercepts, analysed for whole rock Fe suite XRF analysis."													
Five duplicates were excluded as the 1m samples correlated to a interval that was stored as a five metre													
"sample in the assay table, so were not used (LGRC_270 102-107); it is possible these were somehow"

"12	DATA VERIFICATION"													
"The Qualified Persons (QPs) have visited the Project site and have inspected many drill sites, both"													
historical and active. Collar coordinates were measured using a hand held GPS by the geological QP													
"and compared to the surveyed coordinates, and in all cases the surveyed collar coordinates were"													
confirmed.													
The geological QP has also relied upon data validation carried out by site geologists who													
independently recorded the coordinates of holes and compared these against actual coordinates. The													
geological QP is satisfied that the drill hole location data used to compile the Mineral Resource													
estimate is of acceptable quality.													
Geological sample assays were compared against lithological logs and were consistent with the													
"geological intervals. For example, Fe grades of >50% were associated with H/G mineralisation and"													
sometimes BIF; but never with ultramafics.													
"The geological drill hole database was validated initially by the database operator, and queries were"													
sent to site for clarification. The author is satisfied that as many checks and balances as possible have													
"occurred, and any errors or omissions that do exist will only possibly affect the Mineral Resource"													
estimate in a marginal manner.													
"Finally, the drill holes were loaded into Datamine (Section 14) and drill hole traces were visually"													
"checked to ensure they did not exhibit kinking (resultant from erroneous down hole surveys), were"													
"dipping downwards, and the collars were in the expected locations and not offset from the targeted"													
mineralisation without good reason.

"13	MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING"													
"13.1	METALLURGY TEST WORK"													
Engenium managed the metallurgical testwork program for Snark and Banjo. A summary of this													
testwork program is provided below.													
"13.1.1	Summary"													
The hematite mineralisation test work at this stage of the project development was performed on the													
Snark deposit in the central section of the tenement. It is assumed that the results of this testwork also													
apply to the adjacent resource at Drabble Downs. In an earlier programme the hematite deposit at													
Banjo was tested so these results are also assessed in this report.													
There has not been any test work performed on the Central deposit but the same results as per Banjo													
have been applied to the Central deposit as the project geologists has assessed the deposits as having													
similar genesis and structure.													
The testwork was performed based on a DSO operation based on +55% Fe grade mineralisation. A													
"programme of Snark low grade material was tested, as the drill hole intervals were available. This"													
programme was based on 50 - 55% iron grade material. Both programmes are reported in this													
"summary, but the Project only considers the potential DSO material. The low grade material would"													
not normally be considered of sufficient quality to be a DSO product and therefore requires													
beneficiation.													
"13.1.2	Physical Properties of the Mineralisation"													
The drill holes were logged and samples selected for analysis of various parameters. The data is													
"reported in the testwork report but, for clarity, is summarised below in Table 13"

Occupational Health and Safety are paramount in any operation so it is prudent to check for the													
presence of asbestos like mineralisation. While not all asbestiform minerals are a health hazard their													
"presence, or lack, is a major design consideration. Representative portions of the mineralisation were"													
"studied for the presence of asbestos. The results are listed, verbatim, in Table 14 as it affects the"													
operation overall.

The lump production rate by the Snark sample is low; values below 50% are common. This is in line													
with the low strength indicated by the low UCS value. The Banjo result shows a higher lump													
generation rate consistent with the higher UCS data.													
"It would be expected that the lump to fines ratio would drop further due to handling and transport,"													
giving an even lower exported ratio.													
"The handling of an extra product needs duplication of much of the downstream equipment, as well as"													
the addition of a lump re-screening plant at the port.													
"The high LOI is due to the mineral goethite, which would spall to dust in a blast furnace. This"													
reinforces the recommendation of an all fines product so the mineralisation would be dehydrated in													
the sintering bed.													
It is concluded that an all fines product would be a more robust product for the project.													
"The potential DSO would be sourced from the Snark, Drabble Downs, Central and Banjo deposits and"													
treated by crushing and screening to make an all fines product.													
"13.1.4	Beneficiation of Low Grade Material"													
The Snark low grade sample was subjected to some beneficiation assessment. Beneficiation is the													
process of upgrading a lower grade mineralisation to a higher grade by physical means. There were													
two beneficiation paradigms investigated in the testwork; beneficiation by size and beneficiation by													
gravity.													
"These analyses have included the Calcined Iron (CaFe), the iron grade when volatiles like water of"													
crystallisation have been removed. During recent market machinations the main Chinese importers													
"allowed imports of low grade ore, provided the calcined iron value was greater than 60% CaFe."													
"13.1.5	Beneficiation By Size"													
The first testwork was a screening process to investigate a potential high grade stream for blending													
with the DSO material. In the testwork the fines were divided into three sized streams and assayed.													
The size assay data for the sample is supplied in Table 16.

These results showed that no high grade fraction is produced so this method of beneficiation was not													
pursued further.													
"13.1.6	Beneficiation by Gravity"													
In this model the sample is subjected to various fluid shear forces countering the pull of gravity on the													
particles to separate the particles based on their weight. As the test is performed on particles of limited													
"size range the separation basis actually becomes one of density, a mineralogical property, so the actual"													
separation is based on the mineral form. In iron ore processing the iron minerals are heavy so the													
heavy streams are retained as mineral concentrates.													
The three size fractions shown in the size assay table above were subject to gravity processing. The													
"<8, >4 mm material and the <4, >1 mm material were tested in a hutch jig, to check their separation"													
by a jigging technology. The -1 mm material was tested on a shaking table to assess its performance													
when processed by low gravity force concentrators such as spirals.													
"13.1.7	Jigging"													
The jigging test consists of putting the sample into a stack of cylindrical strata elements. The entire													
stack is stroked and pulsed with water to stratify the sample. Each stratum is then assayed. These													
assays are tabled below in Table 17.

"The coarse jig maintains a grade of >60% calcined iron, with reasonable impurity levels only in the"													
"bottom stratum, at a mass recovery of ~9%, related to the original feed sample. The fine jig has a"													
"greater mass recovery of 22% of the original feed mass, at a grade of 60% calcined iron up to the"													
Upper Central stratum. This is conventional behaviour.													
"13.1.8	Shaking Table"													
During the shaking table test the slurry is fed to the corner of the table and the shaking action stratifies													
the light and heavy particles for removal at different points of the table. This demonstrates the

performance of the material being subjected to low-gravity separation. A single Shaking Table test is													
usually considered to simulate the operation of a three-stage spirals plant.

"The testwork results with the low grade composite indicate that, by combining the three products of"													
"the various gravity beneficiation methods, a recovery by mass of 52.5% and a 60% CaFe grade could"													
be achieved. There are also benefits in diluting the impurities intrinsic to the ore.													
Due to a lab test being much more controlled the 52.5% recovery would be derated to 50% for													
"subsequent discussions. This is in line with industry practice of derating laboratory data, typically by a"													
relative 5%.													
"13.1.9	Conclusions"													
No sample tested showed any issue with a crushing and screening operation. The ore appears to be													
friable and easily crushed even when using equipment such as sizers etc. Any modern crushing													
technology would be capable of crushing the material.													
The standard supply of motors for the equipment nominated for throughput would be suitable to treat													
these samples. The feed qualities are summarised in Table 4.1.													
There were no asbestos fibres noted in the samples.													
The Snark samples did not show a propensity to develop a high quality lump product so is best													
considered to be an all Fines potential DSO. The Banjo samples were of lower grade and produced													
a low grade lump and marginal fines grade products. Again this deposit is best considered as an all													
Fines potential DSO.													
"The low grade sample was crushed to -8 mm, screened into size fractions and assayed. There was"													
little variation in the assays by size showing that beneficiation by removing a low grade stream would													
not benefit this sample. Again this shows the material is not that of a typical BIF (which concentrates													
impurities in the fines fractions).													
The low grade composite was tested to assess gravity based processing of the sized material. These													
tests involved both jigging and shaking table testwork. The gravity concentration products were													
analysed and the mass recoveries to produce a 60% CaFe grade determined for the three test regimes.													
"The overall performance of the beneficiation test work performed on the Snark low grade ore, was to"													
produce a 60% CaFe product grade.													
The testwork results with the low grade composite indicate that by combining the three products of													
the various gravity beneficiation methods a recovery by mass of 50% at a 60% CaFe grade could be													
achieved.													
The lower sulphur grade of the coarse jig mediates the higher sulphur grade of the fine jig and table.													
As the final beneficiated products sulphur grade is close to the conventional benchmark careful													
mining and/or blending should be utilised to maintain grade quality. It could also be used to reduce													
the overall Project sulphur grade by blending with the potential DSO product.													
"13.1.10	Recommendations"													
The testwork performed for this study needs updating and expanding over the entire project area. The													
"Snark work was performed on two master composites selected solely on Grade, as there were no other"													
geo-metallurgical parameters available to make such an assessment. The Banjo work was performed													
on individual drillholes and averaged.													
Jan-12													
Page 72 of 180													
Runge Limited													
Further assessment should address the following:													
"	Evaluate the prospect as an all fines product."													
"	Determine tonnage of higher and lower grade material to check if the focus of the operation"													
"would be a DSO operation, based on higher grade material, or a beneficiation plant treating"													
"lower grade, hematite-based material."													
"	Perform further drilling and metallurgical investigations to assess the various mineralisations"													
"of each deposit, as determined by the geological modelling. Each mineralisation should be"													
tested by evaluating its own composite followed by a variability programme assessing the													
selected processing model for each area identified in the mine plan as being of that													
mineralisation.													
"	After the mining schedule is developed a further larger scale assessment should be performed"													
on composites representing each of the initial years feed to both the DSO operation and the													
"Beneficiation Plant, if used."													
"	While the grades and form of the mineralisation probably preclude a lump and fines based"													
operation this should be assessed by testwork to finalise this processing decision.													
"	Water of reasonable quality should be sourced. As it appeared that wet processing would be"													
"needed, the dewatering and effects of residual halide salts in the water would need to be"													
assessed.													
"	The flow characteristics of the crushed ore should be determined in a plant design"													
programme.													
"13.2	PROCESSING"													
The processing of an iron ore converts the Run of Mine (ROM) material into a form treatable by the													
"downstream clients, thus is saleable. Engenium developed the processing methodology for this Project"													
which is described below.													
"13.2.1	Basis of Design"													
The RC drilling programme performed on the Snark Deposit has indicated a range of ore grades. This													
"study is based on the higher grade material, nominated to be the resource calculated at a 56% iron"													
"grade cutoff, expecting an average feed grade of some 57% iron. The drilling at Banjo is not so"													
developed so the assessment of the plant design is based on three diamond drill holes from the													
"deposit. Each ore type will be trucked to a ROM pad for feeding to the processing plant, in a strategy"													
consistent with the mining plan.													
The project product would be a potential DSO All Fines product; a nominal -9 mm product for													
export. This assessment results from the testwork programmes performed on a Snark higher grade													
composite and Banjo diamond drillhole samples. (Refer Section 4.0.) A mobile processing plant is													
"proposed for the crushing and screening part of the operation, to produce the -9 mm fines for"													
stockpiling as DSO mineralisation. This plant can be moved as the ore sources change.													
"Mobile plant design requires a more confined layout than an equivalent capacity fixed plant, due to"													
"restrictions on height, width, length and mass. Hydraulic drives are often used to simplify electrical"													
"installation and reduce external dimensions and plant weight. Reduced access to components, due to"													
"this compact design, could impede plant inspection and maintenance. Mobile plants may not achieve"													
the same plant utilisation as a fixed plant over prolonged use. These disadvantages are offset by the													
equipments low capital cost and the capacity to move the plant as required.

Mobile crushing and screening plants are available from a number of providers based in Western													
"Australia. The crushing contractors use key processing parameters and criteria including design,"													
"production rate, ROM sizing, bulk density, typical product specifications and typical crusher product"													
curves to select equipment configuration and layout.													
"13.2.2	Ore Crushing and Screening"													
"13.2.2.1	Introduction"													
"At mine commencement, production rates, nominally 2 Mtpa of fines product, would be achieved"													
utilising a contracted mobile crushing and screening plant to feed the DSO stockpile. The plant is													
proposed to be in operation for at least 5 years.													
"No provision is included for capital expenditure, other than mobilisation costs, for the crushing and"													
screening equipment as the selected contractor provides the plant and undertakes the crushing and													
screening operation.													
"13.2.2.2	Plant Configuration and Selection"													
The crushing and screening facility would be located within the mine operations centre (MOC)													
"precinct on an area of cleared, level, well-drained land, above predicted maximum flood levels"													
"Typically, the plant would consist of:"													
"	a primary oversize fixed grizzly accessible to the ROM front end loader for clearing oversize"													
ore;													
"	a dump truck/front end loader fed ROM feed bin;"													
"	an apron feeder to discharge the coarse ore from the bottom of the ROM bin at a controlled"													
rate;													
"	a ROM bin discharge vibrating grizzly feeder, to feed coarse material into the primary crusher"													
and to direct fines to the primary crusher discharge belt prior to the primary crusher discharge													
point;													
"	a primary jaw crusher fitted with an hydraulic rock breaker;"													
"	portable conveyors linking key equipment and allowing recirculation of screen oversize;"													
"	a secondary and tertiary crushing module;"													
"	a vibrating double deck screening module producing two oversize streams for crushing and the"													
fines stream;													
"	a transfer / sample station;"													
"	a fines product road train loading conveyor to the truck loadout bin;"													
"	a fixed stacking conveyor to a fines product stockpile;"													
"	an operator control room, complete with process control system and motor control centre;"													
"	portable electrical generating capacity and fuel storage;"													
"	water sprays for dust suppression at transfer points;"													
"	potable, raw and process water distribution systems; and"													
"	high pressure, low pressure (if required) and instrument air production and reticulation systems."													
"The key components including the crushers and screens would typically be skid, track or trailer"													
"mounted to allow haulage to site via low loaders for setting onto prepared concrete footings, where"													
required.

The ROM ore would be loaded into the primary ROM feed bin via direct dumping by haul trucks													
"from the pit, or a FEL sourcing material from fingers of ROM stocks on the central ROM pad."													
"Oversize ROM material would be removed from the primary fixed grizzly by FEL, for secondary"													
breakage. ROM material would be withdrawn by a ROM feeder to a vibrating grizzly feeder directing													
coarse feed to the primary jaw crusher. Nominally -125 mm material passes through the grizzly													
directly to the crusher discharge conveyor.													
The primary crusher would be a single toggle roller bearing jaw crusher capable of crushing scalped													
ROM feed up to -600 mm at a maximum design rate of approximately 303 dtph. Primary crushed													
"product would combine with the vibrating grizzly feeder undersize on the discharge conveyor, passing"													
"under a self-cleaning tramp iron magnet and over a metal detector and weightometer, prior to"													
screening and further crushing.													
"The material would pass over two double deck banana sizing screens, both fitted with nominal 20 and"													
11 mm aperture decks.													
"All oversize particles from the top deck of the screen(s) in use would be directed to a secondary,"													
standard cone crusher. All discharge from the secondary cone crusher would recirculate back to the													
sizing screen.													
The upper deck of the sizing screens passes the -20 mm material for screening by the lower -11 mm													
"screen deck. The material coarser than 9 mm would be directed to a tertiary, shorthead cone crusher."													
All discharge from the tertiary crusher would also recirculate back to the sizing screen.													
All nominal -9 mm material passes through the lower deck of the sizing screen onto the fines product													
discharge conveyor.													
The fines product discharge conveyor would be fitted with a sampler and weightometer. The material													
"would be fed to a fines product road train loading bin, or to a stacker conveyor for emergency fines"													
product stockpiling.													
"The major transfer points, including the stackers would be fitted with water sprays, normally at the"													
conveyor head pulleys. These sprays would moisten the product for dust suppression and													
preconditioning prior to road haulage.													
Weightometers fitted to the primary crusher discharge conveyor and the fines product discharge													
conveyor provide key tonnage data (crushing rate and total tonnes) for the crushing and screening													
"plant. Depending on the level of sophistication of the equipment, the data would be presented in the"													
crushing control room on either a chart recorder/totalizer or a supervisor control and data acquisition													
(SCADA) system.													
"A single control room would be installed, allowing one operator to supervise the operations of the"													
crushing and screening plant. A simulation of the crushing and screening section of the operation was													
developed and is summarised below in Figure 13-3 Crushing and Screening Section Schematic.

The crushing circuit presented above would apply to either mobile or fixed plants.													
It uses conventional crushing equipment but the use of sizers should be considered for handling and													
setup cost savings.													
Material flow characteristics are currently unknown and would be determined during future													
metallurgical testwork.													
Road-train Load-out and Emergency Fines Product Reclaim													
The road-train load-out system would consist of the following typical main equipment items:													
"	a 1,000 t nominal capacity road train loading bin facility;"													
"	FEL Cat 994 wheel loader to reclaim from the emergency fines product stockpiles and to the"													
"road trains, and"													
"	on-highway triple road-trains: 115 t nominal capacity side tippers"													
Rail Load-out Siding Stockyard													
The proposed Menzies South rail load-out siding stockyard geometry would allow for stockpiles as													
"defined in Table 22. Windrow heaps of products, dumped by 115t side tipper triple road-trains, would"													
"be picked up and formed into flat topped stockpiles by FEL. Water would be added to products,"													
"generally raising the moisture content of the ore, preconditioning the product for delivery to the port."													
Stockpiles of product (nominally 30 kt) would be constructed.													
"It is envisaged that one stockpile would be actively reclaimed, while another was being built. At the"													
nominal 2 Mtpa rate (average production rate of 303 t/h) the stockpiles would take approximately 4													
days (each respectively) to construct.													
No sampling would be carried out at the rail load-out siding. Rail load-out and shipping rates would													
closely reflect production rates.													
The stockpiling area would include the following main equipment items:													
"	triple road-trains - 115 t capacity side tipper, and"													
"	FEL Cat 994 wheel loaders."													
The stockyard would allow for approximately 3 weeks production.

"13.2.3	Sampling and Mixing"													
"13.2.3.1	Introduction"													
There are three broad sampling and analysis activities that would need to be undertaken for the													
Project:													
"	exploration and grade control sampling and analysis,"													
"	production stream sampling and analysis, and"													
"	final shipment sampling and analysis."													
The primary purpose of exploration and grade control sampling and analysis is to determine the													
"mineral and physical properties of the body being mined for production purposes. In particular, this"													
"information is used during the mixing procedure (if used), where ore from several in-pit locations"													
"requires mixing to achieve grade requirements. No mixing is envisaged, however due to variability"													
"indications, provision for discrete ROM stockpiles to cater for potential mixing could be provided on"													
"the ROM pad area, as grade control of the product stockpiles is important."													
Production stream sampling and analysis would be required to confirm the quality and size													
distribution of the fines product prior to transport off-site. A site based preparation facility would be													
"included, which would undertake drying, sizing and sample reduction for shipment and shift samples."													
"Shipment sampling and analysis would occur at the port prior to shipping to check size, moisture"													
"content and grade, largely governed by requirements of the purchase contract. Port generated samples"													
would be processed by a local contract laboratory. There would be no facility for blending at the port.													
"13.2.3.2	Ore mixing"													
The operation initially entails the mining of the projects deposits in a controlled programme													
consistent with meeting the project grade and tonnage requirements. It could be expected that													
blending from other pits would be minimised while still achieving customer product quality													
requirements. It is envisaged that sufficient ROM stocks could be held on the ROM pad for													
preliminary process blends to be established via a primary crusher loader blend.													
A more detailed examination of the mine plan together with further metallurgical test work would be													
required to fully understand the impact of the average mine grades on potential blending requirements													
to meet customer specifications.													
The blending strategy for the operation (if required) would be based on meeting customer product													
"specifications. The blending process would rely on timely analysis of products, monitoring quality,"													
quantity and location of product stocks and varying the feed blend to the process plant to meet													
shipment lots sizes. It would be expected that the origin and mineralogical description of the ROM													
"feed would be monitored as well as the ROM blend, through the daily maintenance of stockpile"													
databases.													
"13.2.3.3	Exploration and Grade Control Sampling and Analysis"													
"Most exploration samples would be obtained on site via the use of a RC drill rig, with the exception of"													
some diamond drilling in QA/QC programs and metallurgical testwork programs. The RC drill rig													
"produces a continual stream of crushed rock, which would be collected and placed into bags"													
correlating to hole depth. A composite sample for each 2m of depth would then be created and													
ultimately chemically analysed to help quantify the mineral characteristics of the ore surrounding the													
particular drill hole for each strata.													
Jan-12

Runge Limited													
"Depending on drilling density, sampling of the exploration drilling would normally generate a"													
"reasonable map of the mineral characteristics for each mining area, which could be used for both"													
planning and production purposes.													
"For mining production purposes, additional grade control samples would be required for more"													
accuracy and greater certainty in the grade of each benched lot. Blast hole drilling spoil is commonly													
used for grade control samples within the iron ore industry. Blast holes are normally drilled using a													
"percussion rotary air blast (RAB) drilling rig, which would produce a stream of crushed rock for"													
sampling and analysis similar to the RC drilling rig used for exploration.													
"For this Project, a more intense campaign utilising an RC drilling rig to drill several benches ahead of"													
the mining face could be adopted. This method would allow time for sampling and analysis prior to													
"reaching the mine face, ensuring the grade of the ore is known prior to mining. This method would"													
also assist both targeting the required ore location in-pit and/or mining areas to build-up suitable ore													
"stocks and streamlining ROM logistics for the required mixing operation, by defining accurate"													
modelling of the expected ROM from each of the locations in-pits. Informed decisions could be made													
of the required mix to be processed through the crushing and screening plant.													
Blast hole sampling (RAB sampling) introduces quality control issues through down hole													
"contamination, particularly in wet conditions. RC sampling would provide accurate and repeatable"													
sample results. A benefit of using an RC drill rig to collect samples would be to separate the blasting													
operation from the grade control sampling exercise.													
"During the RC sampling process, the on-site sample preparation facility would prepare and package"													
samples for off-site assay.													
"13.2.3.4	Production Sampling and Analysis"													
"A sample station, complying with ISO 3082-2009, would be provided to collect separate samples of"													
the final products. The sample cutters located at the head end of the product-stacker feed conveyor													
would provide sample increments for products.													
The sampling equipment would generally consist of primary and secondary samplers and rotary													
sample dividers. Primary sample cutters would be used to produce hourly composite samples and													
sample increments would be bulked and processed.													
"The sampling (and blending, if used) methods used would allow operational flexibility by maintaining"													
control of the product grades and product stockpiles. The strategy employed would consist of													
"monitoring blends, product grades and tonnages, and stockpile movements. The data would be used to"													
calculate final product grades at shipment stockpiles and feed back to the mine plan for adjustment so													
off take contractual obligations could be met.													
Shift samples could also be dispatched by fast road or air freight to an off-site laboratory for assay													
"analysis. With regular sample deliveries, contract laboratories could schedule specific machine times"													
for the analysis. Sample results would then be emailed to the minesite.

"14	MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATES"													
"14.1	Software"													
The Mineral Resource estimate for the Ularring Hematite Project was completed using Datamine Studio													
v3.19.4135. Geostatistical analyses were conducted using the Supervisor (Snowden Industries) and													
GeoAccess Professional (Widenbar and Associates) packages.													
"14.2	Mineral Resource Estimate  Snark and Drabble Downs"													
"14.2.1	Drill Hole Database Loading"													
"Eight tables were exported from the drill hole database in csv format. These tables included collars, assays,"													
"surveys, lithology and density."													
"These tables were loaded into Datamine to generate a de-surveyed drill hole file named assay.d. , using"													
Datamines HOLES3D command.													
"14.2.2	Geological Interpretation"													
"14.2.2.1	Lithology"													
No lithological domains were modelled for this Mineral Resource estimate.													
"14.2.2.2	Weathering"													
No weathering profiles were modelled as part of this Mineral Resource estimate.													
"14.2.2.3	Mineralisation"													
Mineralised domains were interpreted to follow the strike of surface mapping; mineralisation sometimes													
"demonstrated continuity by drill results, where surface mapping indicated no outcrop."													
Mineralisation envelopes were modelled based upon a lower Fe grade cut-off of 50%. This was the													
mineralisation cut-off grade used in previous Mineral Resource estimates for the Macarthur Hematite													
Project. The Fe (%) assay grades were displayed against the drill hole trace with the primary lithological													
"code, to ensure that only lithologies associated with iron mineralisation (BIF or hematite/goethite) were"													
captured inside the envelopes. This eventuated to be always the case.													
A general rule followed was to allow up to 2 consecutive metres of less than 50% Fe from any drill hole													
inside a mineralisation envelope. This rule was relaxed to allow for mineralisation marginally below the cut-													
"off grade, especially if needed to maintain strike or depth continuity. An interpretation for any domain"													
required strike continuity along at least two drill sections. Where a polygon was digitised around a drill hole													
"exhibiting Fe mineralisation and no strike continuity was observed, either by closure by drilling, or open due"													
"to no drilling, then that hole and associated domain were not included in the final Mineral Resource"													
estimate.													
Dip and dip direction of the mineralisation envelopes were determined by surface structural readings near													
the drill hole collars.													
"14.2.2.4	Topography"													
A LIDAR topographic survey was flown in June 2011. The data was re-sampled from 1m to 2m and													
exported as a wireframe surface in dxf format. The dxf file was imported into Datamine and saved as a													
Jan-12													
Page 82 of 180													
Runge Limited													
"wireframe surface. The surface was validated against several drill collars, representing different"													
"geographical locations of the resource, to ensure matching elevation levels between drill hole survey and"													
topographic survey. The topographic DTM covers an area significantly larger than the mineralisation													
footprint.													
"14.2.3	Wireframes"													
A total of sixty three (63) wireframe solids were constructed for mineralisation across the Snark and													
Drabble Downs prospect areas. The construction of the solids was controlled by the use of tie lines. End													
"plates were projected approximately 20 metres along strike, or to the limits of surface expression of the"													
mineralisation as determined by outcrop mapping. The wireframes were named and numbered min1_tr/pt to													
"min58_tr/pt for Snark, and min101_tr/pt to min105_tr/pt for Drabble Downs. The *tr/pt notation is the"													
Datamine wireframe filename notation for the storage of related wireframe triangle and point files.													
Depth of mineralisation was set to no more than 55 metres below surface by translating the topographic													
wireframe 55m vertically. Any mineralisation domain extending below this sub surface wireframe was set													
"as barren, via the block model macro (refer section 14.2.8)."													
"14.2.4	Sample Domaining"													
"14.2.4.1	Domain Coding"													
Samples within the Datamine drill hole file were flagged according to the mineralisation wireframe solid													
"within which they were located. Table 23 presents the wireframe names, Datamine variable (MINZON) and"													
associated codes.													
Table 23. Mineralisation Domains and codes

Snark	Mini tr/pt to min58 tr/pt	1 to 58											
Drabble Downs	Min101 tr/pt to min105 tr/pt	101 to 105											
"14.2.4.2	Sample Length Analyses"													
"An analysis of all RC sample lengths, from samples contained within mineralisation domains discussed in"													
"Section 14.2.4.1, indicates that all lengths are 1.0m. Diamond core lengths were not assessed because they"													
"were not assayed, and therefore not used for grade estimation."													
"14.2.5	Sample Compositing"													
"Drill hole samples were composited to 1.0m lengths, based upon the sampling interval described in Section"													
14.2.4.2.													
"14.2.6	Statistical Analyses"													
"14.2.6.1	Summary Statistics - Sample Assays"													
A statistical summary of key assay results for all mineralisation domains combined is presented in Table 24.													
"The statistics demonstrate typical grade distributions for this type of H/G deposit, with negatively skewed"													
distribution for Fe and positively skewed distributions for the other variables. Approximately 20% of the Fe													
"data has assay values of less than 50% Fe, which is related to internal dilution modelled within the"													
"wireframes. Approximately 90% of the Fe population is greater than 47.8%, indicating that modelling has"													
allowed the capture of Fe grades slightly less than the expected cut-off of 50% Fe. This further implies that													
Jan-12													
Page 83 of 180													
Runge Limited													
the dilution constitutes mineralised BIF rather than ultramafic rock which is located to both the hangingwall													
and footwall of the mineralised bands.													
"Summary statistics for Snark and Drabble Downs, based upon domains presented in Table 23, are presented"													
"in Table 25 and Table 26. These demonstrate general similarities between the two deposits, which are"													
expected due to geological similarities and the close proximity to each other. The notable exception is the													
"elevated sulphur grade observed in Drabble Downs, reasons for which are unknown at this stage. Drabble"													
Downs also exhibits a slightly higher LOI than Snark.													
"Summary statistics for grade variables, by MINZON domain, Histograms for Fe, P, SiO2, Al2O3, LOI and"

"14.2.6.2	Mass Balance"													
"An analysis of mass data is required to ensure the assayed grade values (%) sum 100%, within a tolerance of"													
±1.5%. Figure 14-2 demonstrates that the assayed data is mostly within tolerance for each MINZON													
"domain. One notable domain is MINZON = 9, which is intercepted by RC hole LGRC_541, and which"													
exhibits total mass balances of >101% but <102% in most instances. This hole was retained in the Mineral													
Resource estimate.													
"14.2.6.3	Density"													
"Density measurements were conducted on billets of diamond core, and via geophysical down hole density"													
probing.													
"A total of 19 diamond core samples were measured for in-situ density values by ALS Ammtec, Perth. The"													
samples were collected from diamond core drilled in May 2011. A total of 19 samples from 11 holes were													
"selected. One of the holes did not intercept the mineralisation, accounting for two of the samples. The"													
remainder of the samples were derived from zones of mineralisation.													
The density data are displayed as a histogram in Figure 14-3. This demonstrates a mean density value of													
3.05 from the hematite/goethite lenses.

"Figure 14-3. Density analyses, diamond core"													
"Macarthur tested 93 holes with a geophysical probe, using the independent survey company GeoVista,"													
measuring sub-surface insitu rock density and hole diameter. The probe was used on 11 diamond core and													
82 RC holes. A summary of the holes probed is presented in Table 27.

"The down hole intervals were either 0.01m and 0.1m, dependent upon the operator at the time of the survey."													
The raw data was composited by CSA to 0.1m intervals prior to further assessment. The holes were flagged													
according to the mineralisation domain within which the samples were located (refer Section 14.2.4) and													
"composited again to 1.0m intervals. The resultant drill hole data file, containing density, calliper and assay"													
data was output to csv format and statistically analysed.													
Figure 14-4 presents scatter plots of density values against calliper measurements. This demonstrates the													
"two main hole diameter populations (100mm diamond core, 140mm RC) with their attendant samples point"													
diameters. There can be clearly seen a blowout of hole diameter beyond 160mm (10% additional volume to													
"expected), with corresponding low density values. Therefore this data was trimmed, for all Caliper readings"													
more than 160mm.													
"Figure 14-5 presents a scatter plot of Fe v Density, for all mineralisation domains, with calliper readings of"													
<160mm. A line of regression has been calculated for this population. It can be clearly seen that the majority

"There is a marked contrast in mean density values, between diamond core samples and geophysical probe"													
data. CSA are unwilling to apply a low density value averaging 2.6 t/m3 for the Mineral Resource. This is													
the same density as for quartz and is lower than the recommended density value applied to volcano-													
"sedimentary lithologies of the Eastern Goldfields. Conversely, CSA believe the average value of 3.0 derived"													
"from billets of diamond core is slightly too high, based upon discussions with Macarthur geological staff"													
regarding the competency of the mineralised lodes. CSA have decided therefore to take a conservative route

"of locally estimating a very high grade or low grade outlier, which would materially impact the Mineral"

"14.2.7.1	Definitions"													
A variogram is a graph of the variability between pairs of samples against the distance between them in a													
"specific direction. A model is calculated for a particular variogram, which provides parameters known as the"													
"nugget, sills and ranges. An example is provided in Figure 14-6."

number of pairs.													
"The nugget effect is the variability between the closest spaced samples available, which is usually two"													
"adjacent samples from the same drill hole. The nugget value is where the variogram model cuts the Y-axis,"													
and is usually referred to as a percentage of the total sill. The type of variogram that produces such a													
variogram is termed a down hole variogram.													
"The sill is the population variance within a domain, and is often normalised to 1.0. The range is the distance"													
"at which samples are no longer spatially correlated, and can be considered as the point where the variogram"													
model approaches or cuts the sill. This is a subjective decision for which the resource estimator or													
geostatistician will call on their experience from other projects for the same commodity. More than one sill													
is often modelled; the first sill (and short range) defines a range of influence up to which the variance													
between samples may rise very rapidly with increasing distance. Beyond this short range the variability may													
increase less rapidly with distance until the sill is reached.													
"14.2.7.2	Methodology"													
"Prior to generating variograms, the composited drill hole file was split into four populations (domains)"													
reflecting variations in strike of the host lithological units. These domains are presented in Figure 14-7 and													
Table 29.

"An attempt was made to model variograms for each of the variogram domains listed in Table 29, but the"													
"low numbers of sample pairs for domains 1, 3 and 4 resulted in poorly structured variograms which could"													
not adequately be modelled. Therefore variograms were only modelled for data located within variogram													
"domain 2, which had over 2,700 samples. The variogram parameters from this domain would be used for"													
"the other domains, after adjustments made to the rotation of the variogram ellipse."													
Normal down hole variograms were obtained from the 1m down the hole composites. These variograms													
were used to calculate the sample population nugget effect and sample variance related to the shortest													
"distance between samples, for iron, phosphorus and sulphur."													
The nugget effect is the theoretical variance in grade that would be obtained if a duplicate sample was taken													
at exactly the same point in space. The nugget effect is an important measure of the reliability/variability of													
the assay value of samples and is one of the parameters used to determine the weight assigned to individual													
samples when estimating block grades. A sample population with a low nugget means that more reliability													
"can be placed on nearby individual samples to estimate the grade of a block, such as may be achieved with"													
"an inverse distance weighted estimate with a high power. Conversely, a grade estimation from a sample"													
population with a high nugget means that the average grade from a large number of samples will be required													
to give the best estimate of the grade for each block.													
"Spatial variograms were modelled for drill data within variogram domain 2, within the dip plane of the"													
"variogram domain mineralisation wireframes, as per Table 29. Variograms were modelled for Fe, P and S."

The final block model sn0911md dimensions and parameters are listed in Table 31. The parent block sizes													
were based upon approximately half the typical drill spacing. Sub blocks were used to ensure the block													
model honoured the mineralisation zone geometries and the geological contacts. Variable names are

"14.2.9	Grade Estimation"													
"14.2.9.1	Data Used"													
All composited RC drill holes that intercepted mineralisation domains as detailed in Section 14.2.4 were													
available for grade interpolation. Only the portions of the holes intercepting the domains were used.													
Diamond holes were not assayed and therefore not used for grade estimation.													
"Grade variables estimated were Fe, P, SiO2, Al2O3, LOI and S."													
"14.2.9.2	Methodology"													
The grade variables listed in Section 14.2.9.1 were estimated into the mineralisation domains using ordinary													
kriging (OK). This is a distance weighted technique that uses a variogram model to apply weights to a													
"sample grade. A more traditional grade estimation technique, inverse distance squared (IDS), was used to"													
"estimate Fe only, as a check estimate for the OK estimates. IDS applies weights to a sample, according to"													
the inverse of the geometric distance of the sample from the block centroid. Therefore a sample close to a													
block will receive a higher weight (to the power 2) than a sample further away. IDS does not make any													
"recognition of the statistics of the sample population, whereas OK does so via the use of the variogram"													
model and translates geometric distances to geological distances based on the observed sample correlation.													
Each mineralisation domain (MINZON) was estimated only by those composited drill samples located													
within them. This is achieved by using the same MINZON values for samples and blocks. Coding of blocks													
and drill holes is discussed in Sections 14.2.4.1 and 14.2.8.													
A primary search ellipse of 125m along strike by 75m down dip by 25m across strike was used. The													
"minimum number of samples used within the search was 8, with the maximum being 30. The primary"													
"search, or first search volume, was tripled if the minimum number of samples were not encountered within"													
"the various searches. A maximum of six samples per drill hole per block estimate was set, with"													
discretisation of 3 x 3 x 3 used. No octant based search was used.

"Kriging estimation runs for SiO2, A12O3 and LOI used the variogram parameters modelled for Fe to help"													
"ensure consistent major element support. Estimation runs for phosphorus used the P variogram parameters,"													
and sulphur used variograms modelled for S.													
"Variogram ellipses were aligned for each mineralisation domain, using the parameters modelled in Section"													
14.2.7.													
"14.2.10	Model Validation"													
Model validation was carried out graphically and statistically to ensure that block model grades accurately													
represent the drill hole data. Drill hole cross sections were examined to ensure that model grades honour the													
"local composite drill hole grades. Several statistical methods were employed to validate the block model,"													
which included:													
"	Model tonnes vs drill hole meters"													
"	Model grade vs drill hole grade"													
"	Comparison of ID2, Kriged model and composite populations"

"Figure 14-11and Figure 14-12 present histograms comparing model and sample Fe grades, for Snark and"													
Drabble Downs. These demonstrate the required smoothing of data that occurs during grade estimation													
from drill hole sample support of a few kilograms to the volume (support) of the model parent cells.

"Trend plots were generated for Fe and P, in easting, northing and elevation sections, from selected"													
mineralisation domains. These trend plots compare the trends of data in each direction and reveal whether													
the estimated block grades follow the trend of sample grades in each direction. This demonstrates that													
appropriate sample data were selected for estimating the block model domains. Figure 14-13 shows trend													
plots for Fe and P.

14.2.10.4 Cross Sectional Validation													
Computer screen cross sections were used to visually validate on screen drill intercepts. The block estimates													
for iron were checked for similarity to their nearest drill sample intervals. This task was simplified by colour													
"coding blocks and drill assay data with the same colour legend, therefore requiring the visual validation to"													
compare similar colours for blocks and drill data.

"14.3.1	Drill Hole Database Loading"													
"Tables were exported from the drill hole database in csv format. These tables included collars, assays,"													
"surveys, lithology and density."													
"These tables were loaded into Datamine to generate a de-surveyed drill hole file named allass.d. , using"													
Datamines HOLES3D command.													
"14.3.2	Geological Interpretation"													
"14.3.2.1	Lithology"													
No lithological domains were modelled for this Mineral Resource estimate.													
"14.3.2.2	Weathering"													
No weathering profiles were modelled as part of this Mineral Resource estimate.													
"14.3.2.3	Mineralisation"													
Mineralised domains were interpreted to follow the strike of surface mapping. Mineralisation sometimes													
"demonstrated continuity by drill results, where surface mapping indicated no outcrop."													
Mineralisation envelopes were modelled based upon a lower Fe grade cut-off of 50%. The Fe (%) assay													
"grades were displayed against the drill hole trace with the primary lithological code, to ensure that only"													
lithologies associated with iron mineralisation (BIF or hematite/goethite) were captured inside the													
envelopes. This eventuated to be always the case.													
A general rule followed was to allow up to 2 consecutive metres of less than 50% Fe from any drill hole													
inside a mineralisation envelope. This rule was relaxed to allow for mineralisation marginally below the cut-													
"off grade, especially if needed to maintain strike or depth continuity. An interpretation for any domain"													
required strike continuity along at least two drill sections. Where a polygon was digitised around a drill hole													
"exhibiting Fe mineralisation and no strike continuity was observed, either by closure by drilling, or open due"													
"to no drilling, then that hole and associated domain were not included in the final Mineral Resource"													
estimate.													
Dip and dip direction of the mineralisation envelopes were determined by surface structural readings near													
the drill hole collars.													
"14.3.2.4	Topography"													
"Wireframe surfaces were created from the drill hole collars, in the absence of any measured survey data."													
The wireframe surfaces were expanded to cover the entire block model area for each of the resource models.													
"14.3.3	Wireframes"													
Wireframe solids were created from the 3D mineralisation interpreted polygons. The wireframe solids were													
"all combined to form one wireframe solid, which each of the Mineral Resource estimates were based upon."													
Depth of mineralisation was set to no more than 55 metres below surface.

Histograms for the hematite-goethite deposits are shown in Figure 14-15 and Figure 14-16. They show													
well-formed distributions without obvious subpopulations or long tails of extreme values. This is partly a													
"function of the interpretation and sample flagging, and suggests that they are appropriate to the geological"													
style of the deposits.													
The absence of long sample tails means that top cuts on contaminants or bottom cuts on Fe are not													
"particularly required. Aside from considerations of strike direction, these distributions do not indicate a need"

"14.3.7	Spatial Statistics"													
"14.3.7.1	Initial DSO Spatial Statistical Review"													
Variograms for the Banjo - Moonshine drill hole assay data were generated but had very poor structures													
except for the down hole variogram. A large radius variogram model was created as a nominal variogram													
"for estimation, as the experimental variograms were too poor to model."													
"All variograms were traditional variograms, without transformations using 20° latitude (40° included) in the"													
plane of search and no restriction perpendicular to the search.													
"14.3.7.2	Domains for Variography"													
"Based on the univariate statistics for the lenses, a single domain was used along the strike of the lenses."													
"Variograms were created for Fe as a starting point and used also to interpolate P SiO2, Al2O3, LOI and S."													
The major axis for Fe was set along strike with a range of 258m; semi-major down dip ranges of 195m and													
"minor axis ranges across strike of 92m and 68m. Other major elements ranged from 250m (SiO2, East lode)"													
"to 697m (LOI, East Lode). Variogram parameters are presented in Table 36. Variograms for Banjo are"

"14.3.11	Density"													
Macarthur has provided density data and recommendations for H/G mineralisation (Drabble 2010a).													
Early density measurements were based on two data types:													
"	Pycnometer measurements from RC drill chips."													
"	Whole diamond core measured by the weight-in-water, weight-in-air method."													
The pycnometer (or specific gravity bottle) method of determining density can give the particle density of a													
"powder, to which the usual method of weighing cannot be applied. The powder is added to the pycnometer,"													
"which is then weighed, giving the weight of the powder sample. The pycnometer is then filled with a liquid"													
"of known density, in which the powder is completely insoluble. The weight of the displaced liquid is then"													
"determined, and hence the specific gravity of the powder."													
"The whole-core method usually involves a square end-cut piece of diamond core, but can be done on rough"													
"chunks. The sample is weighed in air and weighed again suspended in water, and the specific gravity"													
directly calculated. If the sample is porous or absorbs water it can be coated in wax or spray lacquer or even													
plastic cling film. For square end cut diamond core the length and diameter can be measured with calipers to													
calculate volume as a cross check.													
"Macarthur did not provide descriptions of the density methods used, and the density readings provided all"													
came from other deposits in the same area. Density samples were taken from Clark Hill and Snark but not													
taken at Moonshine.													
"To improve the density data in 2010, Macarthur undertook the following:"													
"	A downhole geophysical logging program, of 2000m over 11 drillholes at Moonshine."													
"	Density measurements on diamond core taken for metallurgical testing - 40 measurements over 4"													
holes.													
"	Surface sampling for density tests - 30 tests."													
In mid April 2010 a program of surface sampling was undertaken within the Banjo and Moonshine													
prospects. The purpose of this program was to provide samples that could be analysed and their dry bulk													
"density (DBD) determined, as well as the geochemistry. The reason for getting both the DBD and the"													
chemistry was so that comparisons could be made with the hope of determining a reliable correlation													
between Fe% and density.													
The sampling programme involved the collection of 15 rock samples from Moonshine (DS_1-15) and 15													
from Banjo (DS_16-30). The samples were collected in a way that was deemed to make the data suitably													
representative. Sampling locations were selected across the outcrops of the mineralised areas so that at least													
1 sample was collected for each part of the resources.													
The technique used was to select one in situ piece of outcrop which was representative of the specific													
"location and break this off using a hammer, retaining it in one piece. Each sample was given a unique"													
sample name (e.g. DS_1); this was recorded along with a description of the geology of each sample and the													
"co-ordinates of its location. This information can be found in 'Table 2'. Each sample was bagged in separate,"													
labelled calico bags and despatched immediately to the SGS metallurgical laboratory in Perth.

Density measurements were taken from four diamond holes drilled into the Moonshine (LGDD_004) and													
Banjo (LGDD_001 to 003) deposits. Part of the test work on this involved a number of DBD													
"determinations. They were tested from various points throughout the core, both in and out of the main ore"													
zone. Table 43 shows the details of where these measurements were taken.													
"The surface sample locations, measured density and selected analyses are shown in Table 40."													
The densities were plotted and various regression lines tested on the graph in Figure 14-22. Note that the													
"average density is 3.50, and average Fe of these samples is 60.6%, somewhat higher than the average grade"													
of the deposits.

"In addition, Macarthur arranged for downhole geophysical logging to be carried out on 11 drillholes at"													
Moonshine.													
"A total of 1916m over the 11 drill holes were logged (Table 41), which included 1461 m logged as BIF,"													
and 18m of hematite mineralized BIF. Average density by logged rock type is shown in Table 42.													
"The density histogram in Figure 14-23 shows that though the overall BIF mean density is 3.1, if the separate"													
"population of densities below 2.5 is excluded (possibly using an Fe grade cut-off), the average will be"													
approximately 3.3. The Fe histogram on the right of the figure demonstrates that the drill holes logged													
covered some lower-grade to unmineralized BIF.													
"The scatterplots with regression lines (Figure 14-24, Figure 14-25) show a positive relationship between Fe"													
and BIF density.													
"Finally, the drill core sample densities (Table 43) show an average density of 2.6, apparently averaging"													
significantly lower than other measures of density.

Scatterplots show a clear relationship of density to Fe content (Figure 14-28). Apart from a number of													
outliers that appear so improbably that they should be excluded as possible bad data. Hellman and Schofield													
(2009) found differences in the results from different drilling phases so a plot was generated of FE vs													
"density for the three groups of results for diamond core (Phase 5), RC Phases 1-3 and RC phases 4 and 6"

This resulted in deposits averaging densities ranging from 3.22t/m3 (Central) to 3.25t/m3 (Banjo).													
"14.4	Mineral Resource Classification"													
"The Mineral Resource is classified as Indicated and Inferred, as required by NI 43-101 and described in the"													
CIM Definition Standards on Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves. The classification level is based													
"upon an assessment of geological understanding of the deposit, geological and mineralisation continuity,"													
quality control results and an analysis of available density information.

"14.4.1	Snark and Drabble Downs"													
"The upper portions of the mineralised rock units have been classified as Indicated, due to the higher drill"													
density (number of holes penetrating the mineralisation in a given volume) penetrating the mineralisation													
near surface. Outcrop mapping also provides information as to occurrence and style of mineralisation at													
"surface, which can be reasonably projected down dip. The largest unknown factor in this Mineral Resource"													
estimate is an understanding of the depth at which the proto-rock type BIF is converted to hematite. Drilling													
"information, in the way of lithological logs from RC chips, and sample assays, controlled the depth extent of"													
"the mineralisation shapes. However, when the deepest hole on a particular section penetrates mineralisation,"													
"the depth at which mineralisation terminates on that section is generally unknown, and subjective. The"													
"mineralisation envelopes were extended to a nominal depth of 55m below surface, however the risk that the"													
"deeper mineralisation indeed exists has resulted in the deeper mineralisation, nominally between 30m and"													
"55m below surface, being classified as Inferred."													
"As drilling density reduces with depth, the higher confidence levels felt for the anticipated occurrence of"													
"mineralisation reduces, to a point where the resource classification level needs be changed to Inferred. The"													
nominal depth at which this occurs has been set at 30m below topographic surface. This is a subjective													
"depth, determined from the Qualified Persons understanding of the mineralisation and geology of the"													
deposit.													
"Exceptions to the above rule are mineralisation domains (MINZON, refer to Section 14.2.4) which either"													
"are informed by too few holes (two or three) to provide sound confidence for the grade estimation, or"													
"sections of well drilled domains where drilling density has dropped, below a nominated depth."													
There is currently no Measured classification applied to this Mineral Resource estimate. CSA recommend													
"Macarthur gain greater understanding of the style of mineralisation and geological controls, and incorporate"													
these into future Mineral Resource estimates. CSA also recommend an improvement in the quality of drill													
"sampling, by more stringent and thorough quality control checks and drill rig inspections by the project"													
"geologists. Further analysis of the density database is required, to provide an algorithm that will provide"													
local density assignments according to the Fe grade of the mineralisation and the geological characteristics													
of the rock. Attention to these areas may allow certain areas of future Mineral Resource estimates to be													
elevated to Measured status.													
"Assignment of resource classification (CLASS variable) to the block model was by the MINZON variable,"													
and / or spatial coordinates. Table 44 presents the classification criteria for the Mineral Resource estimate.

"14.4.2	Central, Banjo, Lost World and Moonshine"													
"The Mineral Resource estimates for Central, Banjo, Lost World and Moonshine have all been classified as"													
"Inferred. This is due to the wide spaced drilling, for which continuity of mineralisation is assumed but not"													
"verified. Many drill sections have only one drill hole, and depth of mineralisation has been assumed. There"													
are not enough QAQC results to support a higher level of classification. Density measurements are based													
"upon a few rock chip samples, measured for density."													
"14.5	Mineral Resource Reporting"													
"The Mineral Resource estimate has been reported above a nominal cut-off grade of 50% Fe, for all blocks in"													
the resource model. No depletion has taken place from earlier mining activity. The entire Mineral Resource													
"estimate has reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction, and is a realistic inventory of"													
"mineralisation which, under assumed and justifiable technical and economic conditions, might, in whole or"													
"in part, become economically extractable."													
"The Mineral Resource is not believed to be materially affected by any known environmental, permitting,"													
"legal, title, taxation, socio-economic, marketing, political or other relevant factors."

"15	MINERAL RESERVE ESTIMATES"													
At this level of study only high level design work has been completed with no accompanying													
schedule. It is noted from the geological section that of the resource almost two thirds (15.8Mt) is in													
the Inferred category of resource and therefore cannot be used in a feasibility study. Thus no estimate													
of Mineral Reserve has been made. A Preliminary Economic Assessment indicates the need and													
suggests the direction for a pre-feasibility study.

"16	MINING METHODS"													
"Mining of the Project will be conducted by conventional drill, blast, load and haul mining methods."													
Potential ore will then be hauled to the Run of Mine (ROM) pad for crushing and then the product													
will be transported by road and rail to the Port of Esperance for export sale.													
"For the purpose of this Study, the mining at the Project would be by open pit and based on a"													
conceptual production rate of 2 Mtpa of potential direct-ship-ore (DSO). A contractor would be													
"engaged to undertake the drill, blast, load and haul to the primary crusher and waste/low grade"													
stockpiles. Sterilisation drilling will be required before waste dump and crusher locations can be													
firmly established.													
"For the drilling and blasting, bench heights would be optimised to suit the drill rig. Explosives used in"													
blasting operations will require storage in on-site magazines.													
Current indications are that the water table in the region of the mineralisation is at varying depths													
from 410mRL to 427mRL and as such below or close to the limit of the current base of known													
"exploitable mineralisation, thus dewatering will not be required until late in the life of any of the pits."													
The natural water table in the area requires further investigation when preliminary pit designs have													
been prepared. There is potential for any water encountered to be reclaimed by pit dewatering for use													
in dust suppression.													
Most of the proposed mining will be above the base of complete oxidation (BOCO). An assessment of													
the geotechnical conditions has largely been drawn from examination of exploration drill cores and													
logs. Rock strength has not yet been tested but has been estimated by observation and simple index													
"testing on cores. Observations of cores, logging data and core photographs indicate that structural"													
"geological defects are dominantly planar, with surfaces varying from smooth to rough. Such defects"													
"are expected to have low shear strengths. It is inferred that typically three defects would be present,"													
bedding and two joints sets forming a sub-orthogonal system. Random defects may also be													
encountered. Pit wall stability will be controlled by geological structures and the poor quality (low													
shear strength) of the country rock mass.													
"Available data indicate toppling, planar sliding and block/wedge sliding mechanisms will be possible"													
should pit walls be developed at angles too steep for the structural geological conditions. The result of													
this work indicates the following design parameters:													
Face height:													
Face angle:													
Berm width:													
Overall angle:													
"10m surface to 30m deep, 15m below 30m deep."													
"55° surface to 30m deep, 60° below 30m deep"													
"5m at 10m, 20m and 30m depths, 7m at 45m & 60m depths"													
~ 43.5° at 60m depth (inter-ramp).													
For the pre-feasibility study an allowance must be made for considerable metres of geotechnical													
drilling to provide data regarding stratigraphic orientation along the strike of the proposed pits.													
Three geological block models (provided by CSA Global September 2011) have been used to develop													
a mining scenario. Snark and Drabble Downs are in a combined block model. The block models are													
based on reporting material above a grade of 50% Fe. The models provided were based on various													
block sizes as detailed on Table 31 and Table 37 in the geological section. These block models were													
regularised to blocks 5m x 2.5m x 2.5m for input into the whittle optimisation software. The block													
size is equivalent to a minimum mining unit (about 100t). Whittle optimisation was then carried out													
Jan-12													
Page 132 of 180													
Runge Limited													
"adopting the geotechnical parameters, the costs scenario as estimated for mining component was from"													
internal databases and for all non-mining costs (such as crushing and transport) as promulgated by													
Engenium. The revenue basis was provided by Macarthur Minerals Limited. The resulting tonnage													
within the whittle shells was determined using a 52% Fe grade cut-off to achieve a final product at a													
calcined Fe grade greater than 60%.													
The resulting optimisation provided the following tonnages and grades:

Note: these figures are based on mineral resources of which a proportion are inferred resources thus													
they are not based on mineral reserves so do not have demonstrated economic viability.													
The resulting shells provided a target for mine design. A preliminary pit design was completed for one													
area of the Snark deposit. This resulted in an estimate conversion factor from a whittle shell to a pit													
design (100% of whittle shell tonnes reported to pit design tonnages with a 152% increase in waste													
mining). These factors were then applied to the total whittle shell results providing the following													
estimate of potentially mineable material. Caution must be exercised in adopting these results as the													
basis for them is substantially an inferred resource on which broad mining factors have been applied													
and thus cannot be used in any definitive valuation.													
Resulting anticipated minable pit tonnages are:

Note: these figures are based on mineral resources of which a proportion are inferred resources thus													
they are not based on mineral reserves so do not have demonstrated economic viability.													
Only the average grades calculated for these figures have been assessed. It can be seen below that the													
Sulphur grade is high and a discount factor has been applied to the revenue stream to account for this.													
"Other impurities such as Al2O3, SiO2 and P are globally within anticipated specifications though on"													
individually pits they may exceed those specifications. Thus some form of blending maybe required.

The anticipated calcined iron grade is above 60% at 60.7%.													
At this level of study only high level design work has been completed with no accompanying													
schedule. It is noted from the geological section that of the 24.4Mt of resource almost two thirds													
(15.8Mt) is in the Inferred category of resource and therefore cannot be used in a feasibility study.													
Thus no estimate of Mineral Reserve has been made. A Preliminary Economic Assessment indicates													
the need and suggests the direction for a pre-feasibility study.													
The pits anticipated are quite small with an anticipated maximum depth of 70m. The pits will be													
spread over a considerable distance of about 25km and hence the crushing plant will be moved at least													
once to keep the raw ore trucking within manageable distances. Operating costs for the mining													
"operation have been built up from first principles, tempered with costs from in-house databases."

"18	PROJECT INFRASTRUCTURE"													
"At mine commencement, production rates, nominally 2 Mtpa of fines product, would be achieved"													
utilising contract mining and an owner operated mobile crushing and screening plant to feed the													
"road train loading bin, with provision for emergency loadout via a mobile stacker to an emergency"													
product stockpile.													
"The key components including the crushers and screens would typically be skid, track or trailer"													
"mounted to allow haulage to site via low loaders for setting onto prepared concrete footings, where"													
"required, and to allow moving the plant to a secondary site as the mining operation develops."													
"18.1	Logistics"													
Initial analysis of the logistics options investigated involved a high level cost comparison. Some of													
the options investigated were dropped from further consideration during this early analysis due to													
their economic viability. Based on the selection of Esperance Port the number of proposed													
routes was reduced to two: a private haul route and a public haul route. Financial analysis in													
previous study work reduced this to one preferred route.													
One aim of the selected haul route was to maximise the use of existing infrastructure from mine													
site to rail siding. The road route:													
"	utilises the existing Evanston Menzies Rd to Menzies,"													
"	bypassing the township of Menzies using the existing Intermin Resources haul road, and"													
"	then travels south on the Goldfields Highway to the proposed rail siding."													
The overall length of the road route from Snark MOC to the rail siding is about 120 km and from													
Central MOC to the rail siding is 140 km. The road route would be suitable for up to 120 t payload													
road trains. For the purpose of this Study it is assumed that 115 t payload road trains would be													
used based on indicative pricing and information from the Toll Group.													
The proposed rail siding is located within tenement Treppo Grande Iron P29/1895													
approximately 8.5 km south of Menzies which straddles the Menzies to Kalgoorlie rail line. A													
front end loader (Cat 988 or equivalent) would transfer the material from the stockpile onto the													
train. Each loaded wagon would be weighed by a track mounted strain gauge weighbridge on the													
"outward bound track. Once the train was fully loaded, it would await direction from central train"													
control to leave the siding and travel to the port.													
The 510 km of rail between Menzies South and Esperance is standard gauge. The rail siding													
lengths between Kalgoorlie and Esperance have recently been upgraded to allow train lengths													
"of 159 wagons. At 71.2 t per wagon the total tonnage that could be hauled by rail is 11,320 t per"													
consist.													
Advice from Brookfield Rail (the rail infrastructure provider) is that timing issues and the													
need for rail infrastructure upgrades to meet these proposed freight volumes is a little difficult to													
"determine at this stage. Brookfield is currently undertaking demand analysis in the Yilgarn region,"													
focussing on the Yilgarn iron mineralisation projects. Brookfield intends to develop a holistic													
approach to the rail expansion required to support these projects and to align with the proposed													
expansion at the Esperance Port.

"18.2	Port"													
The Project is centrally located between a large number of ports in Western Australias South													
West. Early analysis identified that most of these ports were not cost effective based on the road and													
rail haulage operation required to reach the port. Other port options had a development timeframe													
that did not suit this Project. The preferred port was the Port of Esperenece operated by Esperance													
Ports Sea and Land (EPSL).													
"The Port of Esperance is the deepest port in southern Australia, capable of handling Cape Class"													
"vessels up to 200,000 tonnes and Panamax class vessels up to 75,000 tonnes. Esperance Port currently"													
exports 9 Mtpa of iron ore.													
"The Minister for Transport, Hon. Troy Buswell has approved in principle an expansion to the Esperance"													
"Port to 30 Mtpa, worth more than $200 million. This proposed expansion follows on from the"													
$120 million transport corridor currently being constructed.													
The preliminary construction timelines for the Multi User Iron Ore Facility are:													
"	Q1 2011 Ministerial approval (received)."													
"	Q4 2011 Design / Community consult / Commercial agreements / Financing"													
arrangements / Regulatory arrangements.													
"	Q2 2012 to Q4 2013 Construction. and"													
"	Q4 2013 Operating."													
Cashmere Iron Limited (another proposed iron ore exporter) has completed a Definitive													
Feasibility Study (DFS) into expanding the port in two stages: an initial 10 Mtpa increase and a													
second 10 Mtpa increase. Macarthur has been negotiating with both the Port of Esperance and													
Cashmere Iron Limited to ensure they have capacity allocated from any proposed port expansion.													
Macarthur has entered into a legally binding Multi User Iron Ore Facility Access Deed with the													
"Esperance Port Authority, securing a commitment to a 2 Mtpa allocation as part of the proposed"													
expansion of the iron ore export facilities at the Port.													
"18.3	Infrastructure"													
The Project is proposing a staged development with the Snark and Drabble Downs deposits mined first													
then the mining operations and supporting infrastructure moving south in support of the Central and													
Banjo-Lost Worlds deposits.													
The location proposed for the Snark Mining Operations Centre (MOC) would be 1 to 2 km south of													
the Evanston Menzies road and within 2 km of the Snark deposit. An additional MOC has been													
estimated approximately 2km from the additional mining areas. Work is required in further studies													
to validate the MOC locations. Macarthurs capital expenditure required for the hematite proj ect													
would be minimised through the reduction of Macarthur onsite infrastructure by means of contract													
mining and contract roadtrain haulage operations. It could be expected that the respective contractors													
"would provide their own maintenance facilities, administration supervision offices, warehouse and"													
store facilities for the duration of the Project.													
The proposed accommodation camp location is approximately 1.2 km south east of the													
proposed Snark MOC location and about 1.5 km south of Evanston Menzies road. The same													
camp could be expanded to provide accommodation for the proposed future magnetite													
operation.

Expanding the existing exploration camp was reviewed but was considered non-viable as its													
"location would be very close to the Snark deposit, however expansion of the existing exploration"													
camp would be utilised as a temporary solution to accommodate the early and peak construction													
workforce.

"19	MARKET STUDIES AND CONTRACTS"													
The market analysis and assessment is presented below. This section of the Study examines the													
potential to sell the Project tonnage to the market. Reference is made to the June 2011 report by													
Macquarie2 prepared for Macarthur and the QP has reviewed and supports the assumptions used..													
Information is also obtained from a draft Iron Ore Market Report compiled by Macarthur included in													
the Engenium Scoping Study3													
"19.1	Introduction"													
The Macarthur hematite product is expected to be an all fines potential DSO. The hematite ore is to be													
"mined initially from the Snark and Drabble Downs deposits, later expanding to the Central and Banjo"													
"deposits. Production would be at a rate of two million tonnes per annum, grading 55.9% iron."													
"19.2	Iron Ore Markets"													
"Iron ore resources, in the form of hematite and magnetite, are used to make iron and steel. 98% of the"													
"world iron production is used to make steel, which is, globally, the most commonly used metal. The"													
"major growth market for iron ore sinter fines consumed in steel production is China, which should be"													
a core target market for Macarthur. Diversification into other Asian markets is also an opportunity													
due to their close proximity and being subject to relatively low ocean freight cost.													
"19.3	Iron Ore Market Forecasts"													
The fines potential DSO product would be sintered before being used in the steel mills blast furnace.													
CRU is a well-known and respected international commodity research unit. The CRU forecasts for													
global consumption and export of sinter fines is shown in Table 50 and Table 51 below. Both													
"consumption and export are expected to increase in the near term, with 55° the increase in"													
consumption stemming largely from China.

Table 51. Export of Sinter Fines (Mt)													
"19.3.1	Iron Ore Demand"													
"In 2008, due to the global financial crisis impacting on uncertainty in the market, major iron ore"													
customers in Asia either delayed or defaulted on iron ore off take contracts. The downturn in the													
"global market continued into 2009, restricting access to new capital and leading to reduced production"													
by incumbent producers. The market recovered in 2010-2011 with demand increasing to the current													
"level, with seaborne supply stretched to the limit."													
"China has increased production of its own low grade, high recovery cost iron ore resources to meet"													
"demand. Macquarie estimated that at June 2011, of the 300 Mt ore production in China, only 100 Mt"													
would have been produced in an equilibrium market environment. This indicates that the iron ore													
"supply side has a shortage of 200 Mtpa. Until new projects erode this requirement, the market remains"													
tight and iron ore is likely to trade at a level that makes even marginal tonnages viable to extract.													
"19.3.2	Iron Ore Supply"													
"In Q1 2011, Australian iron ore exports were down 12% from the previous quarter, and Brazilian"													
"exports down 16%, both hampered by heavy rains during the quarter. Indian exports had been down"													
"on a yearly comparison for 11 consecutive months at June 2011, equating to 12 Mt of Indian supply"													
for the period of January to April 2011. Macquarie expects limited increase in seaborne capacity over													
the short term and expects the supply side to underperform in the medium term.													
"The Australian iron ore sector is experiencing a surge in capital intensity, which has more than"													
doubled in the past five years and increased in 2011. This is highlighted by a recent announcement by													
BHP Billiton that the expansion to 220 Mtpa in the Pilbara would have a capex of USD180 per tonne													
of annualized capacity. The high capital cost linked with requirements for infrastructure and													
"regulatory approvals, along with the limited ability for debt funding by world financial institutions,"													
continues to act as a significant barrier to entry to new iron ore producers.													
"From Table 50 and Table 51 above, it could be seen that India currently is an exporter of sinter fines."													
The projected level of export decreases due to increased use of the raw material in Indias own steel													
"mills and a limit on exports. Indias gross domestic product has reached USD3,000 per capita. In"													
"developing countries, steel consumption typically increases strongly for several decades once GDP"													
reaches this level and it is expected that India would begin to import sinter fines in the medium-term.													
"This phenomenon underlies confidence among iron-ore producers that, even if current iron-ore prices"													
"are not sustained, the medium-term outlook is favourable."													
"19.4	Market Opportunity"													
The Project would be a very modest share of the Chinese market at less than 1%. The most													
appropriate pricing strategy for Macarthur is one of price follower. Macarthur should seek to													
follow the price of its highest price competitors as closely as possible.

Table 52 Competitor Iron Ore Fines Grades and Pricing													
"From the above Table 52, the price competitors which are closest to the Project grade are Robe River,"													
"PMI and FMG S Fines. These products are sold at the 62% Fe Platts index unit price with a discount,"													
"as their grades are lower than the index. At a 55.9% iron grade, it is expected that Macarthurs"													
hematite ore would be subject to a penalty in the range of USD30 per tonne. The Macarthur potential													
"DSO has a higher sulphur level than competitors, for which an impurity penalty in the range of USD5"													
per tonne is expected. For a general discussion on the potential impacts of iron ore grade and													
"impurity, see Section 19.5 below."													
It should be noted that the Platts Fe price index is based on Australian iron ore exports FOB Dampier													
"port. As the Macarthur hematite potential DSO is likely to be exported from the port of Esperance, the"													
increased freight distance would lead to a port price penalty in the range of USD3.													
The premium difference between the 62% and 58% index is generally lower when the market price is													
"weaker. However, as witnessed in the tight supply environment experienced until mid-2008, discounts"													
that previously applied to lower quality ores could also disappear when market demand exceeds													
supply.													
Jan-12													
Page 141 of 180													
Runge Limited													
An increase in global iron ore consumption and ensuing demand has led to iron ore prices doubling in													
"the past two years, reaching USD180 per tonne FOB in August 2011. The upward pressure on prices"													
has led to movement away from the forward 12 month benchmark pricing by major producers towards													
a market driven pricing model.													
"Macquarie note that from 2012 onwards, slightly less Chinese domestic ore should be required to"													
"balance the iron ore market each year, with the amount left in the market expected to experience cost"													
inflation of 6% per annum. The expectation for the spot price for iron ore is that it would be													
"underpinned by the cost structure of Chinese domestic ore, at USD150 per tonne. It is expected that"													
"any spot market impacts on the price of iron ore due to destocking is likely to be short-lived, with"													
most small mill inventories at around 30 days of use.													
"19.5	Iron Ore Types"													
"Economical iron ore production usually accesses magnetite, hematite or goethite ores. Magnetite ores"													
"(Fe3O4) when beneficiated, contain a slightly higher grade of iron than either hematite or goethite ores"													
(Fe2O3). Steelmakers are able to consume any of these ores in their blast furnaces and pricing													
differentials are not related to the primary ore type. Steelmakers could readily switch between													
magnetite and hematite ores if the right pricing signals were received. Value in use issues for iron													
"ore are related to differences between ores such as iron grade, impurity level, physical structure and"													
steelworks plant configuration.													
"19.5.1	Iron Ore Grade"													
The objective of the blast furnace operator is to produce iron. It is unusual for steelmakers to place													
value on any other constituents of the ore. In the vast majority of cases ores with higher iron content													
are worth more than ores with lower iron content. This is reflected in the longstanding industry													
Jan-12													
Page 142 of 180													
Runge Limited													
practice of purchasing ores on the basis of U.S. cents/metric tonne unit. Steelmakers are only													
"interested in the value % of the iron contained within the ore, not the volume of ore per se."													
"19.5.2	Impurities"													
"Impurities in iron ore are a critical issue as they impact on the efficiency and, by extension, the"													
operating cost of the blast furnace. By mixing ores with different impurity levels in appropriate													
"proportions during the agglomeration process or in the blast furnace, a steelmaker could produce an"													
"average blend with trace impurities that are acceptable. Thus, steel companies often accept iron ore"													
"products with impurities in limited quantities, typically up to a specified percentage of the overall"													
feed.													
The impact that this has on value appears to be very much a matter of negotiation. It is not always													
possible for a steel maker to isolate the exact costs related to removing a specific impurity from their													
iron ore feed stock. Blending operations are broad in their range of complexity across different steel													
makers. The level of complexity impacts more on the overall cost of blending more so than on the													
marginal cost. The bulk of the cost of raw material blending is incurred configuring the logistical set-													
"up of storage areas, stackers, reclaimers and conveyors."													
"19.5.3	Physical Structure"													
The physical structure of the ore is a critical issue for the blast furnace operator. For the process to													
"operate effectively, gases must flow through the blast furnace in an even manner. Blast furnaces are in"													
"continuous operation and need to be stable. If the structural properties of the burden are out of control,"													
"there is a risk that the furnace may become clogged, leading to loss of production efficiency, excess"													
wear on the lining and even serious accidents. Efficient blast furnace operations continue to operate													
for 7-10 years before being shut down for a major rebuild. The blast furnace burden usually consists													
"of a blend of sinter, lump, pellets, coking coal, and limestone. Generally, lump or pellets are required"													
in the blend in order to ensure an efficient flow of gases in the furnace.

"20	ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES, PERMITTING AND SOCIAL/COMMUNITY IMPACT"													
Environmental approval of the Proposal from various Decision Making Authorities (DMAs) of the													
Western Australian and Australian government will be required under various pieces of													
environmental legislation before the Proposal can be implemented. The Proponent is required to													
conduct an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) of the Proposal to allow assessment and													
"approval of the Proposal by DMAs. In order to facilitate EIA, a number of environmental studies and"													
stakeholder consultation sessions will be or have been facilitated by the Proponent to allow													
environmental data for the Proposal area to be collected and stakeholder requirements considered.													
This will allow DMAs to assess and approve components of the Proposal requiring approval under													
applicable environmental legislation.													
"20.1	Existing environmental knowledge"													
Environmental studies of varying levels have been conducted across the greater Macarthur tenement													
area since 2009. A summary of each environment factor investigated appropriate to the Proposal thus													
far is outlined below.													
"20.1.1	Flora and vegetation"													
The greater Macarthur tenement area is located approximately 100 km west of Menzies and lies													
within the Coolgardie Botanical District (Beard 1990). This corresponds with the Coolgardie 2													
Bioregion (COO2 - Southern Cross subregion) and East Murchison subregion (MUR1) as defined by													
the Interim Biogeographical Regionalisation for Australia (IBRA) (Cowan et al. 2001; Cowan 2001).													
"This subregion is characterised by high species and ecosystem diversity, as it is a biogeographic"													
interzone between the Coolgardie and Murchison biogeographic regions (Cowan et al. 2001).													
Broad vegetation mapping by Beard (1972) provides descriptions of vegetation associations in the													
Project area and surrounds. The Project area and surrounds contains three different Beard vegetation													
associations:													
"	Medium woodland: Salmon Gum (Eucalyptus salmonophloia) and Goldfields Blackbutt"													
(Eucalyptus lesouefii);													
"	Shrublands: Acacia neurophylla, A. beauverdiana and A. resinomarginea thicket; and"													
"	Hummock grasslands, mallee steppe: red mallee over Spinifex (Triodia scariosa)."													
A Desktop Study of the flora and vegetation for the greater Macarthur tenement area was completed													
in 2010 (Outback Ecology 2010b). A Level 1 flora and vegetation survey (as defined by EPA													
Guidance Statement No. 51 [EPA 2004b]) was also completed across eight exploration prospects in													
"the greater Macarthur tenement area, including the Central and Snark deposits (Outback Ecology"													
"2010a). These studies were conducted to review databases, publicly available information and"													
"previous assessments in the area to understand the potential type, distribution and conservation"													
significance of flora and vegetation types that may exist within the survey area. These studies													
identified there is potential for flora species and vegetation communities of interest to occur within the													
"greater Macarthur tenement area. Subsequently, Level 2 flora and vegetation surveys (as defined by"													
EPA Guidance Statement No. 51) were commissioned for 2011 for the proposed Ullaring Hematite													
Project (the Project) with Autumn surveys completed in May 2011 and Spring surveys in September													
2011 (Mattiske 2011 and in preparation).													
Numerous plant taxa and vegetation communities were recorded within the survey area and													
preliminary results suggest that the vegetation communities and flora recorded are widespread and													
Jan-12													
Page 144 of 180													
Runge Limited													
typical of the greater area. Final Level 2 survey reports are not expected for completion until the end													
of November 2011 and therefore limited data was available at the time of writing this report.													
"No Declared Threatened Flora (DRF) species and up to seven Priority Flora species, including"													
"Grevillea georgeana, Hibbertia lepidocalyx subsp. tuberculata (J.R. Wheeler) (P3), Mirbelia sp."													
"Helena & Aurora (B.J. Lepschi 2003) (P3), Spartothamnella sp. Helena & Aurora Range (P.G."													
"Armstrong 155-109) (P3), Banksia arborea (P4), Grevillea erectiloba (P4) and potentially Eucalyptus"													
formanii (P4) have been recorded within the survey area. Further investigations into the distribution													
and sizes of these populations were undertaken as part of the 2011 Spring Level 2 flora and vegetation													
survey to determine if the priority flora species are locally significant or more widespread taxa.													
"No Threatened Ecological Communities (TECs), as defined by the Western Australian Department of"													
Environment and Conservation (DEC) (2011a) and the Environment Protection and Biodiversity													
Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act) are known to occur in the greater Macarthur tenement area													
(Mattiske 2011). Eleven Priority Ecological Communities (PECs) as defined by DEC (2011b) have													
been recorded within and near the greater Macarthur tenement area (Mattiske 2011).													
The Level 1 and 2011 Autumn Level 2 flora and vegetation survey identified that two of these PECs													
may occur within the Project survey area; the Ularring vegetation complexes (banded ironstone													
formations) Priority 1 PEC and the Banded Ironstone Hills with Banksia arborea Priority 1 PEC													
"(Outback Ecology 2010a, Mattiske 2011). Currently, no PECs have been identified within the Project"													
"area, however, Banksia arborea (P4) was recorded on banded ironstone formations during the Level 1"													
"and Level 2 surveys (Outback Ecology 2010a, Mattiske 2011). Limited information has been"													
"provided by the DEC to date on these PECs and therefore, given the absence of any specific"													
"information, it is difficult to determine if these two PECs occur within the Project area and to"													
determine the locality of each potential PEC within the Project area if it exists (Mattiske 2011).													
Based on initial observations by Mattiske during Autumn 2011 Level 2 flora and vegetation surveys it													
appears that the Eucalyptus stricklandii vegetation association (Eucalyptus stricklandii Low Open													
Woodland over mixed Acacia and Eremophila Tall Shrubland or Frankenia sp. Low Shrubland) is not													
"restricted to the Project area or greater Macarthur tenement area, and the significance of this"													
vegetation association appears to be lower than what has been currently documented by Outback													
Ecology (2010a). Further investigations into this association across the greater Macarthur tenement													
area was undertaken as part of the Spring 2011 Level 2 flora and vegetation survey.													
"20.1.2	Fauna"													
Desktop assessments and higher level surveys have been undertaken within the greater Macarthur													
tenement area to develop an inventory of fauna that occurs or is likely occur within the Project area													
"including terrestrial vertebrate fauna species, terrestrial invertebrate Short Range Endemic (SRE)"													
invertebrates and subterranean fauna. The studies were also undertaken to provide a description of													
"vertebrate fauna habitat, sensitive habitat and terrestrial invertebrate SRE habitat that occurs within"													
and surrounding the Project area. Survey findings will be compared to regional studies undertaken in													
"the region, where available to assist with environmental impact assessment for this factor. The"													
following sections summarise current available information pertaining to each relevant fauna group.													
"20.1.2.1	Terrestrial Fauna"													
The desktop assessment (Outback Ecology 2010c) identified five broad terrestrial vertebrate fauna													
"habitats that are expected to occur within the Project area, comprising:"													
"	BIF;"													
"	Shrubland over sandplain;"													
Jan-12													
Page 145 of 180													
Runge Limited													
"	Woodlands / mallee;"													
"	Mulga / Acacia shrubland; and"													
"	Breakaway / Granite outcrops."													
The assessment also identified that fauna habitat and fauna species of interest potentially occur within													
the greater Macarthur tenement area. Therefore Level 2 fauna surveys (as defined by EPA Guidance													
Statement No. 56 [EPA 2004c]) were proposed and an Autumn survey was conducted over the Snark													
"deposit, Mining Operations Centre (MOC) and Accommodation Camp site in May 2011 (KLA 2011)."													
The Autumn Level 2 survey recorded a total of 55 vertebrate fauna species including 12 reptile													
"species, five native terrestrial mammal species, one exotic terrestrial mammal species, six species of"													
bats and 30 bird species in the survey area. Opportunistic surveys recorded an additional three reptile													
"species, one amphibian specie, one native and two exotic terrestrial mammal species and six bird"													
"species. Overall, the trap rate for the Autumn survey was low and this is considered likely due to the"													
cooler temperatures at that time of the year (KLA 2011).													
"Excluding the possibilities for an un-identified bat species (Nyctophilis spp.) (P4), no mammals or"													
reptiles of conservation significance were recorded during the survey. Two birds of conservation													
significance were recorded in the survey area including the White-browed Babbler (P4)													
(Pomatostomus superciliosus) and the Crested Bellbird (P4) (Oreoica gutteralis). These are both													
listed as Priority fauna species under DECs Priority Fauna List (DEC 2010). Fauna listed as Priority													
fauna species have a moderate level of conservation and represent a limited risk to development													
which can be typically ameliorated through management practices.													
"Bird sightings, scratchings and potential breeding mounds of the Malleefowl (Leipoa ocellata), listed"													
as a threatened/vulnerable species and protected by the EPBC Act and Western Australian Wildlife													
"Conservation Act 1950 (WC Act), have also been observed within the greater Macarthur tenement"													
area. Observations and the significance of the Malleefowl are discussed in greater detail below.													
The overall condition of the vegetation within the Autumn Level 2 fauna survey area is described as													
Excellent (KLA 2011). While the removal of native vegetation for the Project will cause minor													
"impacts on fauna, the vegetation is not considered to be significant habitat for fauna indigenous to"													
Western Australia (KLA 2011).													
Level 2 surveys for the remainder of the Project area are ongoing and due for completion in 2012.													
These surveys are expected to give Macarthur a greater understanding of the fauna assemblage within													
the Project area and identify potential conservation significant species identified by the Desktop Study													
to assist with environmental impact assessment.													
Malleefowl													
Malleefowl are protected under Commonwealth and State legislation. They are listed as Vulnerable													
under the EPBC Act and are a Schedule 1 species under the WC Act. Malleefowls geographic													
distribution includes much of the southern half of Australia from the Great Dividing Range to the													
"west coast but its geographic range has contracted in recent years. In Western Australia, Malleefowl"													
"occurs as far north as Carnarvon, most of the south-west corner and much of the inland semi-arid"													
areas below the 26th latitude and the coastal strip of mallee south of the Nullabor Plain between													
Cocklebiddy and Eucla (Benshemesh 2000). The habitat requirements of Malleefowl are generally													
not well understood but the Malleefowl is now primarily found in semi-arid and arid shrublands and													
low woodlands dominated by mallee.													
Malleefowls are known to occur within the greater Macarthur tenement area based on recorded													
observations of both Malleefowls and breeding mounds by exploration staff and subcontractors. A													
Jan-12													
Page 146 of 180													
Runge Limited													
targeted survey for the Malleefowl across portions of the proposed Project area was conducted in July													
and August 2011 to identify potentially active breeding mounds that may be impacted by the Project													
and to assess the risk to local Malleefowl populations as a result of the Project.													
"So far the targeted survey has covered the Snark deposit, MOC and Camp site and some of the Central"													
"Prospect. Preliminary results of the targeted survey include the observation of two birds, evidence of"													
"various types of local activity such as scratchings and scats, and over 50 breeding mounds (classified"													
"as either extinct, inactive and potentially active) within the survey area. Approximately 37 mounds"													
"occur within or surrounding the combined area that includes the Snark deposit, MOC and Camp site,"													
however only one of these mounds was classified as potentially active4. Of the 16 mounds observed													
within the Central Prospect area during the July/August 2011 targeted survey four potentially active													
mounds were observed. The rest of the mounds within the survey area were classified as inactive													
and extinct and these mounds are considered unlikely to be re-used by Malleefowl (Thompson S													
"[Terrestrial Ecosystems] 2011, pers comm. 1 September). At this stage of planning it cannot be"													
confirmed whether the potentially active mounds occur within the final Project area. These													
potentially active mounds will be monitored prior to and during the 2011/12 breeding season from													
September 2011 to March 2012 to assess if they are being actively utilised.													
Additional Malleefowl targeted surveys for the remainder of the Project area are planned for 2012.													
Where active Malleefowl mounds are present in a development area it is considered likely that													
"the Australian Government Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and"													
Communities (SEWPaC) will issue the Proponent with a Controlled Action notice. In most													
circumstances a management plan will be required to minimise potential impacts on Malleefowl													
in the area and the Proponent may be required to monitor these potential impacts for the life of													
the mine.													
"20.1.2.2	Short Range Endemics"													
"SREs are invertebrate species restricted in range to a particular area, at a continental, national or local"													
"scale. SRE species have naturally restricted ranges of less than approximately 10,000 km2 (Harvey"													
2002). SREs also tend to occur in isolated habitats such as outcrops and mesas (EPA 2009). Seven													
groups of invertebrates are recognised as containing high proportions of SREs including													
"mygalomorph spiders, pseudoscorpions, scorpions, millipedes, land snails, earthworms and isopods."													
Prominent ridges of banded ironstone present with the greater Macarthur tenement area are considered													
to be potential SRE habitat as they are both relictual and fragmented where immigration and													
emigration are likely to be limited for certain taxonomic groups (Outback Ecology 2010c). These													
"ridges include ironstone hills and granite outcrops and breakaways. Subsequently, a SRE survey was"													
conducted in 2011 with an approach and methodology based on EPA Guidance Statement No. 20													
(EPA 2009). The survey was conducted across the Project area to target the seven main groups of													
recognised SREs.													
"Preliminary survey results suggest that, based on the latest survey results and species observation"													
"work, potential SRE species may be restricted to the Project area. Consultation with the"													
Environmental Protection Authority (EPA) and DEC will be undertaken in late 2011 to determine if													
additional SRE surveys are required to further understand the extent of these species.													
4 A potentially active' Malleefowl breeding mound is defined as a mound that still retains the shape and structure of a typical													
Malleefowl mound and has the potential to be actively used by a Malleefowl for breeding purposes during the next or future													
breeding season.

"20.1.2.3	Subterranean Fauna"													
Subterranean fauna occupy underground habitats and are divided into two broad categories;													
stygofauna and troglofauna. Stygofauna are obligate groundwater-dwelling aquatic fauna that inhabit													
"a range of groundwater systems, spending their entire life cycle below ground. Typical groundwater"													
"habitats of stygofauna include large caves, mesocaverns in karst and basalts and the interstitial spaces"													
of alluvial aquifers. The most common stygofauna in Western Australia are crustaceans (EPA 2003).													
"Some species of stygofauna have extremely localised patterns of distribution, linked to a lack of"													
connectivity between aquifers (Watts & Humphreys 2001).													
Troglofauna are obligate terrestrial fauna that inhabit air chambers in underground caves or small													
humid air-filled spaces (EPA 2003). While troglofauna have commonly been found in karstic													
"limestone systems, they may occur in other fractured and cavernous geology types. Examples of"													
"troglofauna invertebrates include spiders, scorpions, centipedes, millipedes, insects and crustaceans"													
"(EPA 2003). Due to long periods of isolation and a lack of connectivity between populations, some"													
troglofauna species have a restricted distribution (Watts & Humphreys 2001).													
Many Western Australian subterranean fauna species are of conservation significance as they appear													
"to represent links to the time when Australia was part of Gondwanaland, bordered by the Tethys Sea"													
"(Humphreys 1993). In addition to this, troglofauna and stygofauna in Western Australia exhibit high"													
"levels of endemism, with many of the species having restricted ranges characteristic of subterranean"													
fauna worldwide (EPA 2003).													
"A subterranean fauna pilot study conducted in early 2011, with an approach and methodology based"													
"on EPA Guidance Statement No. 54a (EPA 2007), identified that potential habitat for subterranean"													
"fauna occurs within the greater Macarthur tenement area, including the Project area"													
(Rockwater 2011). Additional subterranean fauna surveys were commissioned in 2011 across the													
Project area to expand on the existing data for Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) purposes.													
Troglofauna samples for the 2011 survey were collected in August and preliminary results suggest													
that no troglofauna species are restricted to the Project area. Results suggest the troglofauna													
community within the greater Macarthur tenement area is generally depauperate and may be of low to													
"moderate diversity by Yilgarn region standards (Evelegh N [Rockwater] 2011, pers comm. 12"													
August). No stygofauna data in addition to the pilot study was available at the time of preparing this													
"report. The first round of stygofauna sampling was conducted during August 2011, with a second"													
round of sampling proposed for November 2011. The final results and report for subterranean fauna													
is expected by December 2011.													
"20.1.3	Hydrology and hydrogeology"													
A baseline hydrology assessment was conducted across the greater Macarthur tenement area in March													
"2011 (GRM 2011a). The regional climate was described as highly variable, both spatially and"													
temporally which can make hydrologic analysis and the design of water management measures													
difficult. Flows in onsite ephemeral creeks and drainages may be high at times during the cyclonic													
period and may cause localised flooding if appropriates surface water management measure are not													
implemented.													
Peak hydrological flow estimates can be determined by standard calculation methods and the													
engineering design of specific surface water management measures will be completed once the mine													
facility layout plan is more advanced. Potential management measures include the design and													
"construction of flood protection diversions and bunds, culverted road crossings etc (GRM 2011a)."

The iron ore deposits predominantly occur within Banded Iron Formation (BIF) that occurs within a													
"sequence of volcanogenic sediments, and mafic and ultramafic rocks that form the Archaean Yerilgee"													
"greenstone belt. BIF is an aquifer in favourable situations, such as where it is cut by faults and"													
fractures or weathered to form a porous rock mass. Recording of hydrogeological data during the													
early phases of the exploration program has been limited but groundwater has been intersected in													
some exploration drill holes in the greater Macarthur tenement area. Other potential aquifers in the													
"area include quartz-rich metasediments, gabbro, and the sheared granite/greenstone contacts. The"													
"depths of fractured-rock aquifers in the area are not known, but they are likely to extend down to"													
about 100 to 120 m depth (Rockwater 2010).													
A baseline hydrogeology assessment was conducted in 2010 identifying that it may be challenging to													
find a large groundwater supply source of low-salinity within at least 150 km of the greater Macarthur													
"tenement area (Rockwater 2010). However, it is expected that sufficient water should be available for"													
the early stages of the Project and for the accommodation camp from aquifers in the greater													
"Macarthur tenement area, in particular weathered and fractured BIF (Rockwater 2010). A"													
palaeochannel aquifer is inferred to exist beneath the Rebecca palaeodrainage divide which is													
understood to run essentially north south dissecting the greater Macarthur tenement area to the west of													
Moonshine (GRM 2011b). This is considered to be a potential source of large groundwater supply													
but it is probably hypersaline. This aquifer is likely to comprise coarse sands of 10 to 20 m thickness													
at a depth of around 70 m (Rockwater 2010). Groundwater flow direction for most of the Project area													
"is considered to be to the west, with salinity increasing toward Ularring and away from the drainage"													
"divide. Flow direction from the more eastern tenements is assumed to be to the east, also flowing"													
away from the drainage divide (GRM 2011b).													
A dewatering assessment has been conducted for the Snark deposit. The relationship between the													
groundwater level and base of ore has not been determined at this time. Groundwater levels along the													
Snark orebody ranged between 410 to 427 mRL and groundwater yields were very low													
(<0.1L/second). Available data indicated that groundwater flowed in a westerly direction towards													
"Ularring, which is consistent with regional information (GRM 2011b)."													
A groundwater supply exploration program has since been conducted across the greater Macarthur													
tenement area in July and August 2011 to begin the search for a feasible groundwater supply for													
"potable, processing and dust management purposes. Large scale faulting and geophysical lineaments"													
were targeted and the greatest yield observed in the exploration holes was 1.8 L/sec from fractured													
"BIF and ultramafic sequences. The groundwater salinity at these sites was approximately 2,000 mg/L"													
Total Dissolved Solids.													
Additional dewatering assessments within the Project area will be undertaken in 2012 once													
understanding of the potential pit outlines becomes further advanced. Macarthur will continue to													
search for a sufficient groundwater supply of suitable quantity and quality within the Project area.													
"20.1.4	Aboriginal heritage"													
The Western Australian Department of Indigenous Affairs (DIA) administers the Aboriginal Heritage													
Act 1972 (AH Act) which provides protection for all places and objects that are important to													
Aboriginal people through the connection to culture. The AH Act protects Aboriginal sites whether													
or not they have been previously reported.													
There are no registered Aboriginal heritage sites located within the Project area or within the proposed													
rail siding site (DIA 2011). There are a number of mythological sites located to the east of the greater													
Macarthur tenement area but these sites were identified by the DIA to have insufficient information													
and subsequently are not registered (DIA 2011). These sites will not be impacted by the Project.													
Jan-12													
Page 149 of 180													
Runge Limited													
A heritage survey is currently being conducted in accordance with EPA Guidance Statement No. 41													
(EPA 2004a) across the greater Macarthur tenement area involving both archaeological and													
ethnographical surveys. Seven archaeological sites have been identified within and surrounding the													
"Project area (Glendenning W [Warranup Pty Ltd] 2011, pers comm. 7 October). Traditional Owner"													
Group representatives will be invited on site to assess the significance of these archaeological sites to													
assist with the consultation process going forward if disturbance of these sites is proposed.													
Traditional Owner Group representatives have also identified two ethnographic sites of ceremonial													
and mythological significance; the Lake Giles Rockshelter and Quartz Quarry Complex and Lake													
Giles Rockhole. The Lake Giles Rockshelter and Quartz Quarry Complex occurs within the Project													
area at the Central Prospect while the Lake Giles Rockhole occurs outside the Project area at the													
"Moonshine Prospect (Glendenning W [Warranup Pty Ltd] 2011, pers comm. 25 October)."													
"Under Section 17 of the AH Act it is an offence to excavate, destroy or damage, conceal or otherwise"													
alter an Aboriginal site unless authorised to do so by the Minister. The Project will aim to avoid													
"archaeological and ethnographic sites where possible. However, if disturbance of a site cannot be"													
"feasibly avoided, the Proponent must obtain permission from the Minister for Indigenous Affairs"													
under Section 18 of AH Act prior to any disturbance commencing. If permission is granted by the													
"Minister, the Proponent will liaise with the relevant local Aboriginal groups to determine appropriate"													
"site mitigation strategies, such as the potential relocation of archaeological sites."													
There are currently no registered native title claims over the Project area.													
"20.1.5	Acid and Metalliferous Drainage"													
The potential environmental risks associated with Acid and Metalliferous Drainage (AMD) come													
"from the presence of sulfides, in particular pyrite (FeS2), that occur within waste material in the pit"													
zones (particularly below the groundwater table). Pyrite typically remains stable when it is saturated													
"by water in its natural environment. However, if it is exposed to oxygen (i.e. during excavation or"													
"lowering of the water table from dewatering) it may oxidise and release dissolved sulfate, causing an"													
increase in acidity and iron concentrations in the surrounding groundwater.													
Water in contact with potentially acid forming (PAF) material may attain a low pH. In addition to													
"causing high sulfate levels, it can potentially induce weathering of clay minerals in the host material,"													
"releasing other metals through mineral dissolution (such as aluminium, manganese, zinc and/or"													
copper) into the drainage. In the event that acid generated has been completely neutralised by the													
"dissolution of common carbonate minerals such as calcite, dolomite, ankerite and magnesite, metals"													
that were released may still remain in the solution or may result in the water becoming highly saline													
(DITR 2007).													
"In addition to posing an AMD risk, an elevated sulfur content combined with organic carbon can also"													
pose a self-heating risk potentially resulting in spontaneous combustion. The presence of PAF													
material also presents a risk to human health from the detrimental effects of pyritic dust particulates													
and gases produced by the oxidation of PAF material. The PAF material may also pose an													
operational risk by causing the premature detonation of nitrate based explosives such as Ammonium													
Nitrate-Fuel Oil (ANFO) (Rumball 1991).													
The potential to encounter PAF material during mining and the potential for AMD is being considered													
by the Proponent. A Waste Characterisation study has been commissioned to conduct geochemical													
testing of the primary waste rock types associated with the proposed deposits. The assessment of													
AMD potential will be identified in the final report expected at the end of 2011.

"20.1.6	Pending environmental studies and reporting"													
Flora and vegetation													
Spring Level 2 flora and vegetation surveys were conducted in September 2011 to:													
"	confirm the status of vegetation communities mapped during the Autumn 2011 survey;"													
"	collect annual species and species in flower opportunistically to supplement existing records;"													
"	target some known Priority flora species to confirm population size and the location within"													
the Project area;													
"	confirm the local significance of the Eucalyptus stricklandii Low Open Woodland vegetation"													
association within the Project area; and													
"	assess the potential for the presence and or absence of potential PECs within the Project area."													
A Level 1 flora and vegetation survey of the proposed rail siding south of Menzies was also													
conducted in September 2011.													
The requirement of potential surveys along the proposed haul road to the proposed rail siding is still													
being investigated pending ongoing discussions with the Shire of Menzies.													
Fauna													
A Level 2 fauna survey was conducted in late October 2011 to complement and expand on the fauna													
observations and assessment of the survey area made during the Autumn 2011 survey. This survey													
will provide a further risk assessment to determine potential impacts to fauna of interest resulting													
"from the Project and provide subsequent recommendations, including the management of perceived"													
impacts to fauna habitats and fauna of interest within the Project area. Additional Level 2 terrestrial													
vertebrate fauna surveys for the remainder of the Project area are planned for 2012.													
The potentially active Mallefowl mounds identified within the Project area will also be assessed for													
signs of current breeding activity during the Level 2 Spring fauna survey. The activity of the mounds													
will also be regularly monitored prior to and during the 2011/12 breeding season from September -													
March 2012.													
A Level 1 terrestrial fauna survey of the proposed rail siding south of Menzies was also conducted in													
late October 2011.													
The requirement of potential surveys along the proposed haul road to the proposed rail siding is still													
being investigated pending ongoing discussions with the Shire of Menzies.													
It is understood that the final subset of subterranean fauna data will be collected onsite in November													
2011 unless the results indicate there is a requirement for further sampling. The final subterranean													
fauna report is expected in December 2011.													
The final SRE report is expected in December 2011. As discussed in Section 20.1.2.2 the results of													
the investigation and the potential for SREs in the Project area will be discussed with the EPA/DEC to													
understand if additional SRE surveys will need to be commissioned in 2012 in an attempt to reduce													
the number of potential SREs restricted to the Project area.

Hydrology and Hydrogeology													
A surface water management study for the development is proposed for 2012 once the mine facility													
"layout plan is more advanced in order to design flood protection diversions and bunds, culverted road"													
crossings etc.													
"Depending on the actual water requirements identified for the Project to support potable, processing"													
"and dust management purposes, further water exploration program across the greater Macarthur"													
tenement area may be required in 2012 to expand on the current dataset.													
Additional dewatering assessments within the Project area will also be undertaken in 2012 once													
understanding of the potential pit outlines becomes further advanced.													
Heritage													
The final report on the archaeological and ethnographical survey is expected in December 2011.													
"20.1.6.1	Mine Closure Plan"													
Planning for mine closure should be an integral part of mine development as mine closure is a critical													
"component of environmental management in the mining industry to ensure a mine can be closed,"													
"decommissioned and rehabilitated in an ecologically sustainable manner, consistent with agreed post-"													
"mining outcomes and land uses, and without unacceptable liability to the State of Western Australia"													
(EPA/DMP 2011). A Mine Closure Plan must be prepared by the Proponent to demonstrate to													
"regulators, based on reliable science-based and appropriate site-specific information, that ecologically"													
sustainable closure can be achieved.													
Closure planning is progressive and a Mine Closure Plan will continue to be adapted as necessary													
throughout the life of a mine. A preliminary closure plan will be prepared and submitted with the													
Mining Proposal for assessment by the DMP under the Mining Act 1978 (WA) (Mining Act). It will													
be prepared in accordance with the Guidelines for Preparing Mine Closure Plans (EPA/DMP 2011)													
and the plan will be continuously reviewed and updated every 3 years for the life of mine.													
"DMP requires the lodgement of a financial security, an Environmental Bond, by the Proponent as part"													
of the assessment of the Mining Proposal under the Mining Act. This is to ensure they adequately													
rehabilitate mining sites after completion of their operations and the State is not exposed to													
unacceptable cost should mine operators fail to meet the rehabilitation requirements on their													
tenements (DMP 2010).													
The Western Australian Government is in the process of reforming the current environmental bonds													
system. For Mining Proposals submitted to DMP in 2012 the schedule of bond rates will be area-													
based as outlined in													
"Table 53. From 1 January 2013, the minimum bond amount will be set at 40% of the total estimated"													
"mine rehabilitation and closure costs for a third party, and this will increase to 50% from 1 January"													
2014 (DMP 2010).													
Minimum bond rates will be calculated once the PFS is complete and greater detail of the													
development is known.													
Jan-12

Runge Limited													
Table 53 Minimum bond rates for the Project													
Rate	Description	Rate/ha (minimum)											
1	"Tailings storage facilities, including in-pit disposal, heap/vat
leach, evaporation dams, turkey nest dams, higher risk waste
dumps (e.g. sulphides present, highly erodible or >25m high)."	$18 000											
2	"Lower risk waste dumps, ROM pads, low grade oxide stockpiles,
plant sites, workshops and process water dams."	$15 000											
3	"Camp sites, strip mining (backfilled mining voids), hyper saline
pipelines (>15 000 TDS), causeways, haul roads, sewage ponds
and landfill."	$7 500											
4	"Roads and access tracks, fresh water pipelines, laydown areas,
borrow pits and airstrips."	$4 500											
Bonds may be reduced where rehabilitation has been carried out satisfactorily and has clearly													
demonstrated stability under at least average seasonal conditions. Bonds will only be retired when the													
"rehabilitation has met all completion criteria and standards set out in approval documents, annual"													
environmental reports and decommissioning plans.													
"The following investigations, programs and/or assessments will be completed by the Proponent in"													
order to prepare an appropriate Mine Closure Plan.													
Waste characterisation													
A Waste Characterisation study has been commissioned to conduct geochemical testing of the													
primary waste rock types associated with the proposed deposits. The potential for the Project to													
expose PAF material and to generate AMD will be assessed in the preliminary report expected at the													
end of 2011.													
The Yilgarn Craton includes some areas identified by the DMP as regions with potential for													
asbestiform material occurrence (DoIR 2001). The potential for encountering asbestiform minerals													
during the proposed operations will also be assessed by the Waste Characterisation study.													
Topsoil and subsoil characterisation													
A Topsoil and Subsoil Characterisation study will be commissioned by the Proponent in the coming													
months to assess how this material should be stored for the life of mine and to identify if and how this													
material can be most effectively used for rehabilitation purposes.													
Landform design and erodibility studies													
Landform design and erodibility studies will be commissioned by the Proponent in the coming													
months to ensure that subsequent waste landforms and abandoned pits at the completion of													
"mining are safe, stable and non-polluting. Final waste landforms must be impervious to erosion"													
and support native vegetation to meet closure expectations.													
Stakeholder consultation													
Jan-12													
Page 153 of 180													
Runge Limited													
Closure related issues have not been addressed during preliminary consultation events between DMAs													
and the Proponent conducted thus far during the planning phase of the development. The Proponent													
will identify key public and government stakeholders and develop a stakeholder consultation program													
"in the coming months to review, discuss and identify the following:"													
"	mine closure issues and risks and how these can be managed at different stages of mine"													
closure planning													
"	stakeholder interests and concerns"													
"	closure strategies and objectives"													
"	potential post closure land uses such as pastoral activities and/or ecosystem re-establishment"													
for conservation purposes													
"	the status of any negotiations or agreements between key stakeholders and the local"													
community.													
Outcomes of the stakeholder consultation program will be considered and addressed in the Mine													
Closure Plan.													
Closure costing													
A detailed closure costing report will be prepared once the PFS is complete. It will outline the													
"process, assumptions and methodology for calculating the cost estimates which will be transparent"													
and verifiable to demonstrate to DMP that the Proponent has properly considered and fully													
"understood the costs of meeting closure outcomes identified in the plan, and made adequate"													
provisions in corporate accounts for these costs. Refining closure cost estimates will be a key													
component of the periodic review of the Mine Closure Plan.													
Estimated costs will take into account all aspects of closure costs. The estimate will include:													
"	earthmoving and land forming"													
"	management of problematic materials where relevant"													
"	research and trials"													
"	decommissioning and removal of infrastructure"													
"	remediation of contamination"													
o survey program													
o remediation program													
o maintenance and monitoring													
"	progressive and final rehabilitation"													
"	maintenance and monitoring programs (including post closure phase)"													
"	ongoing stakeholder consultation process"													
"	closure project management costs (administration, consultant fees and legal requirements)"													
"	provision for unplanned closure / care and maintenance"													
"	need to allow for earthmoving machinery to be available on site after closure for remedial"													
earthworks.													
"20.2	Potential environmental impacts"													
"20.2.1	Flora and vegetation"													
Without mitigation the following aspects of the Proposal may affect flora and vegetation values:													
"	clearing of vegetation for the Proposal will directly reduce the extent of vegetation"													
communities (including vegetation communities of local conservation significance) and													
potentially disturb Priority Flora species													
Jan-12													
Page 154 of 180													
Runge Limited													
"	disruption of natural surface hydrology (i.e. sheet flows) through extension of mine pits,"													
"and construction of waste dumps, infrastructure and diversion structures has the potential to"													
have an impact on vegetation communities that are sustained by sheet flow													
"	vehicle movements and earthworks have the potential to introduce and spread exotic weed"													
species													
"	dust generation due to earthworks, mining, processing and vehicle movements has the"													
potential to smother vegetation.													
"20.2.2	Fauna"													
The following aspects of the Proposal may affect terrestrial fauna values:													
"	clearing of vegetation will directly disturb fauna habitat by removal, degradation or"													
fragmentation of habitat													
"	disruption of natural surface hydrology (i.e. sheet flows) has the potential to have an impact"													
on vegetation communities that are sustained by sheet flow and subsequently affect fauna that													
may use this habitat													
"	vehicle movements within the Project area may result in the loss of individual terrestrial fauna"													
"	exotic fauna species may be introduced and/or increase due to attraction to the area"													
"	noise and light produced by the development may disturb local fauna."													
Activities or aspects of the Proposal that may potentially affect subterranean fauna include:													
"	habitat disturbance through removal of topsoil, overburden and ore will result in the loss of"													
troglofauna habitat and the deaths of some individuals of troglofauna													
"	surface water and groundwater contamination through spills of hydrocarbons or wastewater"													
has the potential to degrade the subterranean environment													
"	changes to surface hydrology, particularly in regards to sealing of recharge areas and"													
"increased surface water runoff, leading to a reduction in habitat suitability."													
"20.2.3	Hydrogeology and hydrology"													
"At this stage of the Project, the requirement of dewatering and the locality of groundwater supply"													
extraction is not well understood. Therefore potential groundwater impacts by the Proposal cannot be													
determined until the pit model is further advanced and further studies are completed.													
The following aspects of the Proposal may affect surface water values:													
"	modifying landforms through the construction of pits, dumps and infrastructure may affect"													
"surface water flows, which may indirectly affect vegetation that is dependent on flows (where"													
flows are reduced) or affect vegetation sensitive to inundation (where flows are increased													
and/or ponding is introduced or prolonged)													
"	contamination of surface water is possible from suspended solids, hydrocarbon or chemical"													
"spills, acidic and/or metalliferous drainage within mining areas."													
"20.2.4	Other factors"													
"20.2.4.1	Aboriginal heritage"													
Earthworks and clearing during construction and operation of the mine and associated infrastructure													
has the potential to disturb archaeological sites and ethnographic sites.													
Jan-12													
Page 155 of 180													
Runge Limited													
"20.2.4.2	Acid and Metalliferous Drainage"													
At this stage of the development the existence and requirement of AMD management is unknown.													
Therefore potential impacts of AMD by the Proposal cannot be determined until the ongoing studies													
are complete.													
"If PAF material will be disturbed by the Proposal, it will be managed in accordance with the"													
"Environmental Management Plan (EMP), as described in Section 20.4.8, so the risk of AMD"													
production from the mine site is minimised.													
"20.2.4.3	Air quality, noise and light pollution"													
There are no townsites or other sensitive receptors within 30 km of the Project area. Due to the small													
"to moderate scale of the Project, the lack of processing facilities besides crushing and screening, and"													
the lack of nearby sensitive receptors suggest that environmental impacts on air quality would not be													
significant at a local or regional scale. Air quality is likely to be primarily of health and safety													
"concern, however, dust could cause damage to vegetation and fauna habitat, as well as reduce visual"													
amenity.													
"Sources of noise from mining include vehicles, blasting and the operation of machinery and"													
equipment which could affect Mining Camp residents and disturb the behaviour of terrestrial fauna.													
Prolonged exposure to excessive noise may also damage hearing.													
Light spill also has the potential to disturb nocturnal fauna and potentially benefit introduced													
predators.													
"20.3	Community factors and stakeholder relations"													
"20.3.1	Socio-Economic Aspects"													
"The proposed Project is situated in the Shire of Menzies, in the Northern Goldfields. The Shire of"													
"Menzies is 125,000 km2 in area, is sparsely populated, with a population of approximately 400 (Shire"													
"of Menzies 2011). The nearest towns are Menzies, Ularring, Kookynie and Leonora. The area has"													
been associated with mining and pastoral activities since the 19th Century and these remain the													
primary industries. Other economic activities include farming and tourism.													
The Project lies within the Southern Cross subregion of the Coolgardie Bioregion. In this subregion													
"the dominant land uses are pastoralism (ie grazing of native pasture - 17%), unallocated crown land"													
"(UCL) and crown reserves (67%), cultivation (dry land agriculture, 2.3%) and conservation reserves"													
(11.5%) (Cowan et al. 2001). The Project area itself falls within UCL.													
"Due to the remoteness of the location, socio-economic impacts of the Project associated with noise,"													
"vibration, dust, light emissions, reduced visual amenity, use and storage of hydrocarbons and other"													
"chemicals, and the generation and storage of wastes are unlikely to be significant at a local or regional"													
scale.													
There is one haul route option currently under consideration on which to transport the ore from the													
"mine site to the proposed rail siding site, which would use both existing public roads and constructed"													
private roads. This haul route has a much lower environmental footprint than a fully private haul road													
"with required upgrades not likely to require significant additional clearing, and would likely encounter"													
fewer tenure issues.

Consultation with Main Roads WA and the Shire of Menzies is ongoing to establish a potential													
"agreement between the Parties and to discuss requirements for traffic modelling, road upkeep"													
arrangements and infrastructure.													
"20.3.2	Community Relations"													
The Shire of Menzies covers a large area and has a sparse population with just 400 residents (Shire of													
Menzies 2011). Consultation and engagement with community organisations and members would													
form an integral part of project development and progress. Preliminary stakeholders identified													
include:													
"	Menzies Bush Fire Brigade,"													
"	St Johns Ambulance Volunteers,"													
"	School and community groups,"													
"	Conservation Council of Western Australia,"													
"	Wildflower Society of Western Australia,"													
"	Riverina Station Owner,"													
"	Intermin Resources, and"													
"	Traditional Owner Groups."													
"20.3.3	Government Relations"													
Consultation and early engagement with government organisations and decision making authorities													
across numerous government agencies is integral to project development. Government relations													
"would be relevant to project development, operational and post mining phases of the project."													
Identification of stakeholders requiring or already engaged in consultation include:													
"	DMP (Regional and Perth),"													
"	DEC Regional Office,"													
"	DEC Environment Management Branch,"													
"	Environmental Protection Authority,"													
"	Commonwealth Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and"

"	Esperance Ports Sea and Land,"													
"	Department of Indigenous Affairs,"													
"	Western Australian Planning Commission (WAPC), and"													
"	Department of Transport (DoT)."													
"20.4	Environmental management"													
The Proponent will develop an EMP aligned to ISO 14001:2004 environmental management													
principles. The EMP will consider site specific issues for both construction and operation of the													
Proposal. The EMP prepared for the Proposal will be based on an adaptive approach and likely													
include management measures for the following:													
"	flora and vegetation"													
"	terrestrial fauna"													
Jan-12													
Page 157 of 180													
Runge Limited													
"	weeds and feral animals"													
"	subterranean fauna"													
"	groundwater"													
"	surface water"													
"	hydrocarbons, chemical and explosives"													
"	noise and vibration"													
"	fire"													
"	waste and AMD"													
"	Aboriginal heritage"													
"	dust"													
"	visual amenity"													
"	mine closure (rehabilitation and decommissioning)."													
"20.4.1	Flora and vegetation"													
Management and mitigations measures outlined in the EMP will be implemented to protect flora and													
vegetation within the Project area. These measures may include:													
"	flora and vegetation management actions to:"													
o ensure that clearing is undertaken in accordance with relevant regulatory approvals													
and is kept within the Proposal area													
o minimise disturbance through early planning and location of infrastructure within													
already disturbed areas wherever possible													
o backfill waste rock and tailings and locate stockpiles in open pit voids where possible													
o undertake progressive rehabilitation of disturbed areas													
o minimise dust generation within disturbance areas													
o avoid disturbance to Priority Flora species wherever possible													
o establish exclusion zones to protect vegetation of moderate or higher conservation													
significance within the Proposal footprint.													
"	fire management actions in all operational and adjacent areas."													
"	weed management actions in all operational and adjacent areas, including to:"													
o identify and map the extent and distribution of target weed species occurring within													
the Proposal area													
o establish and maintain an inventory recording the location of weed species within the													
Proposal area													
o inspect sites to record new observations of weed infestations													
o control weed occurrences prior to disturbance at the site													
o undertake staff inductions to include information on identification and reporting of													
weeds and procedures to prevent the introduction and spread of weeds													
"o implement weed quarantine and hygiene measures for all people, parts, plant,"													
machinery and supplies entering and leaving the Proposal area													
o minimise site disturbance by preventing unnecessary clearing of vegetation													
o implement a weed control program for targeted weed species.													
"20.4.2	Terrestrial fauna"													
Management and mitigations measures outlined in the EMP will be implemented to protect terrestrial													
fauna within the Project area. These measures may include:													
"	vegetation clearing will be minimised where possible and restricted to designated areas"													
"	natural drainage lines will be maintained wherever possible"													
"	progressive rehabilitation will be undertaken to re-establish fauna habitat"													
Jan-12													
Page 158 of 180													
Runge Limited													
"	guns and pets will be prohibited onsite"													
"	feeding of and/or direct interaction with fauna will be prohibited"													
"	appropriate speed limits will be implemented and sign posted and vehicles will be prohibited"													
from travelling off designated roads unless in the case of emergency													
"	options for mitigation of light and noise emissions will be investigated"													
"	undertaking feral animal control"													
"	translocating conservation significant species, where feasible"													
"	staff and contractor inductions will include information about significant species and"													
management responsibilities.													
"20.4.3	Surface water"													
The following management and mitigation measures may be required to address/minimise the													
potential impacts to surface water:													
"	applying appropriate engineering stormwater management design to manage surface water"													
flows in accordance with latest best practice and/or Australian Standards													
"	constructing on-site drainage in a manner which directs flows from disturbed areas to"													
sedimentation traps to minimise turbidity prior to being discharged off site													
"	installing appropriate bunding and hydrocarbon/chemcial management in hydrocarbon and"													
chemical storage facilities re-fuelling locations and stationary hydrocarbon and chemical													
usage areas													
"	treating and stockpiling any potentially acid forming or non-acid metalliferous materials"													
appropriately to avoid surface water contamination													
"	constructing and using hydrocarbon treatment facilities at wash down and workshop areas."													
"20.4.4	Groundwater"													
The following management measures may be required to address/minimise the potential impacts to													
groundwater:													
"	regular assessment of potable water requirements and implementing opportunities for water"													
use efficiency													
"	development and implementation of a bore maintenance schedule to minimise seepage into"													
the mine pit													
"	development and implementation of a water quality and depth to water table monitoring"													
program and schedule													
"	include education on hydrocarbon, chemical and waste management spill response procedures"													
within staff inductions													
"	install appropriate bunding and hydrocarbon/chemical management at hydrocarbon and"													
"chemical storage facilities, re-fuelling locations, and stationary hydrocarbon and chemical"													
usage areas													
"	construct and use hydrocarbon treatment facilities at wash down and workshop areas"													
"	store, handle and dispose ablution effluent and waste in a safe manner."													
"20.4.5	Aboriginal Heritage"													
"Under section 17 of the AH Act, it is an offence to disturb any Aboriginal site without consent under"													
section 18 of that Act. A detailed archaeological and ethnographic Aboriginal heritage survey is													
being conducted to determine the occurrence of any Aboriginal sites within and immediately													
surrounding the Project area. If Aboriginal sites are identified within the development areas and they													
Jan-12													
Page 159 of 180													
Runge Limited													
"cannot be avoided, approval to disturb the sites will need to be sought in accordance with section 18"													
of the AH Act.													
Heritage values in the Project area will be protected where practicable through implementation of the													
following measures:													
"	ensuring that ethnographic and archaeological surveys cover all areas where ground"													
disturbance is proposed													
"	continuing consultation with the traditional owners regarding the Proposal"													
"	educating staff/workforce about heritage values of Proposal area, and the importance of"													
protecting these values													
"	avoiding all Aboriginal heritage sites unless specifically permitted to access or disturb a site"													
for the purposes of implementing the Proposal in agreement with traditional owners and in													
accordance with the AH Act													
"	fencing/signposting, or otherwise clearly demarcating exclusion zones around, Aboriginal"													
heritage sites within and around the Proposal area that are not proposed to be disturbed													
"	seeking clearance to disturb sites that cannot otherwise be avoided (as aforementioned)."													
"20.4.6	Visual amenity"													
The management of visual amenity impacts will be addressed by the EMP and may include the													
following proposed management actions:													
"	implementation of vegetation and flora management measures which will include numerous"													
actions pertinent to visual amenity such as:													
o limiting and minimising clearing and disturbance													
o backfilling of waste rock and tailings in pit voids (to reduce footprints and perceived													
impact on landform) where possible													
o minimising dust generation													
o avoiding conservation significant flora and vegetation													
o fire and weed management													
"	implementation of progressive rehabilitation with the objective of achieving safe, stable, self-"													
sustaining landforms sympathetic to the visual character of the area													
"	implementation of a Mine Closure Plan with the objective of the mine being closed,"													
"decommissioned and rehabilitated in an ecologically sustainable manner, consistent with"													
"agreed post-mining outcomes and land uses, and without unacceptable liability to the State."													
"20.4.7	Light and noise"													
Lit areas will be restricted to accommodation areas and the processing plant facility if possible. The													
impact of light spill may be reduced by the potential installation of sodium lights and by minimising													
light broadcast.													
Noise associated with all mining activities must meet the requirements of the Mines Safety and													
"Inspection Act 1994, Mines Safety and Inspection Regulations 1995 and Environmental Protection"													
(Noise) Regulations 1997. Given the lack of nearby noise sensitive premises (eg. residences) noise is													
likely to be readily managed using standard management procedures.													
"20.4.8	Waste and Acid and Metalliferous Drainage"													
"The requirement of AMD management for the Project is yet to be determined. However, if AMD"													
management is required it will be managed using current industry recognised best practice. This													
Jan-12													
Page 160 of 180													
Runge Limited													
"includes regular monitoring of performance through rock sample collection, water quality testing and"													
auditing against the EMP for compliance. PAF material waste will be managed in accordance with													
the EMP to ensure there are no long-term environmental impacts on the groundwater aquifer and													
"surface water systems, both locally and regionally."													
"During operations, PAF material waste (if encountered) will likely be placed in designated PAF"													
"material waste dumps. Where necessary, PAF material that also has spontaneous combustion risk"													
may be placed in a specifically designated waste dump. PAF material waste dumps will be designed													
and constructed in accordance with the EMP using common industry best practice to reduce the risk													
of AMD formation and to ensure dumps are effectively decommissioned and rehabilitated at closure.													
PAF material waste dumps may have the following features:													
"	the base and outer skin of the PAF material waste rock dump will have at least 5 m of inert or"													
net-neutralising waste rock to minimise surface water flow through risks and so that no													
sulfidic material is located within 5 m of the dump surface													
"	the thickness of each lift of PAF material would not exceed 10 m"													
"	during construction the upper dump surface would be designed so that it only receives"													
incident rainfall with no run-on from adjacent areas													
"	a store and release cover would be placed on temporary above ground PAF dumps that are"													
complete and will not be backfilled into the pit within two years.													
The Proponent will obtain environmental licences under Part V of the Environmental Protection Act													
1986 (WA) (EP Act) for the treatment and/or disposal of sewage and waste within the Project area.													
The storage and disposal of wastes generated by the Proposal will be controlled in accordance with													
"conditions set out in the environmental licence, and also through implementation of the management"													
measures. Potential management measures may include:													
"	maintaining and servicing equipment regularly"													
"	disposing of putrescible and inert waste to an appropriately licensed facilities (either on- or"													
off-site (wastes will be segregated to facilitate recycling and appropriate disposal where													
possible)													
"	collecting and treating ablution effluent in an appropriately licensed sewage treatment facility"													
"	maintaining sediment control structures at washdown facilities"													
"	maintaining hydrocarbon treatment facilities at the workshop and washdown facilities"													
"	re-using treated water from the workshop and washdown facilities for dust suppression where"													
possible													
"	disposal of liquid hydrocarbon waste through a licensed contractor."													
"20.4.9	Hydrocarbons and hazardous materials"													
Potential management and mitigation measures for storing and handling hydrocarbons and other													
chemicals may include the following measures to protect the environmental values of the Project area:													
"	containing and bunding hydrocarbon and other chemical storage and refuelling facilities in"													
accordance with best practice and to relevant Australian legislation and standards and													
environmental operating licence conditions													
"	use of absorbent matting and spill kits at each hydrocarbon and chemical storage facility"													
"	minor spills will be captured on spill matting and remediated"													
"	all workshop areas will be designed with closed drainage systems which feed to oil-water"													
separators													
Jan-12													
Page 161 of 180													
Runge Limited													
"	sub-surface and above-ground pipework and storage tanks containing hydrocarbons will be"													
"periodically inspected, pressure-tested and maintained to ensure that leakages are prevented"													
or detected as early as possible.													
"Should asbestiform minerals be encountered during exploration and mining, management and"													
mitigation measures will be undertaken in accordance with best practice and the Management of													
Fibrous Minerals in Western Australian Mining Operations (DMP 2010) draft guideline.													
"20.5	Environmental approval process"													
There are a number of approval pathways available to the Proponent and the following pathway for													
primary and secondary approvals is considered to be the most applicable to the Proposal and suitable													
for the Proponent in terms of potential timing and costs involved in the approvals process.													
The Primary Approvals Pathway involves the following steps. It should be noted that the first two													
steps can be undertaken concurrently:													
"	preparation of an Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999"													
(Australian Government) (EPBC Act) referral to be submitted to the Australian Government													
"Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities (SEWPaC)"													
and preparation of an Assessment of Referral Information (ARI) or Assessment of													
Preliminary Documentation (APD) for assessment under the EPBC Act.													
"	preparation of a Section 38 referral to be submitted to the Western Australian Environmental"													
Protection Authority (EPA) and preparation of an Assessment of Proponent Information													
(API) and Mine Closure Plan for assessment under the EP Act pending instruction from the													
EPA.													
"	preparation of a Mining Proposal to be submitted to the Western Australian Department of"													
Mines and Petroleum (DMP) and assessed under the Mining Act 1978 (WA) (Mining Act).													
The Secondary Approvals Pathway involves the following sequential steps:													
"	preparation of a Clearing Permit Application to be submitted to the DMP and assessed under"													
the Mining Act if the Project is not assessed under Part IV of the EP Act.													
"	preparation of Works Approval and Licensing applications to be submitted to the DEC and"													
assessed under Part V of the EP Act.													
"	preparation of Section 18 applications to be submitted to the Western Australian Department"													
of Indigenous Affairs (DIA) and assessed under the Aboriginal Heritage Act 1972 (WA)													
(AH Act).													
"	preparation of Section 5C and 26D licences to be submitted to the Western Australian"													
Department of Water (DoW) and assessed under the Rights in Water and Irrigation Act 1914													
(WA) (RIWI Act).													
The above scenario includes referral of the Project to the EPA to see whether it requires assessment													
under Part IV of the EP Act. This eliminates the risk of the DMP or another third party referring the													
Project to the EPA under Section 38 of the EP Act for assessment at a later date and ultimately													
"slowing down the environmental approvals process. However, Macarthur Minerals believes that"													
assessment under Part IV of the EP Act will not be required because it does not consider the proposed													
mining operation will have a significant impact on the environmental for the following reasons:													
"	the proposed mining operation is of a small - moderate scale with a short life of mine of 5"													
years and a mining rate of approximately two million tonnes per annum only													
Jan-12													
Page 162 of 180													
Runge Limited													
"	ongoing environmental investigations have not identified any environmental values that are"													
restricted to the Proposal area and/or cant be typically ameliorated through management													
practices													
"	the environmental values observed within the Proposal area appear to be regionally"													
widespread													
"	it is expected the degree of public interest in the Proposal will be local only"													
"	the Proposal is not wholly or partly within the following areas:"													
"o any national, state or conservation parks and/or reserves"													
o TECs													
o World Heritage Property													
o Biosphere reserve													
o Soil reference site													
o Ramsar or ANCA wetlands													
o sites visited by migratory species listed under the JAMBA or CAMBA agreements.													
"	the Proposal is considered unlikely to have an effect upon environmentally significant lakes"													
or wetlands													
"	the Proposal is not within 2 km of the coastline or a declared occupied townsite"													
"	no dewatering is expected and the Proposal is considered unlikely to impact on a water"													
resource area.													
If the EPA decide the Project does require assessment under Part IV of the EP Act it will likely be													
assessed at the following level: Assessment on Proponent Information (API). This assessment does													
not involve a public review but will be slower than assessment under the Mining Act generally taking													
5-8 months to approve once the API document has been submitted for assessment.													
A Mining Proposal is usually processed within a target timeframe of 30 working days from													
submission. More time may be taken if insufficient information is provided by the proponent. If the													
DMP do consider the Mining Proposal may cause a significant environmental impact they can seek													
further advice from the EPA/DEC but they cannot refer the Mining Proposal to the EPA if the project													
has already been referred.													
Ongoing consultation with DMAs will be conducted by the Proponent to confirm the assessment and													
approval pathway. This advice will become more certain as the planning stage of the Proposal													
progresses (i.e. amended footprint areas and ore processing designs etc) and more environmental data													
becomes available. It is anticipated that the assessment and approval pathway for the Project will be													
determined by February 2012.													
An assessment of key environmental factors which may provide a risk to the delay of the Proposal													
implementation date is provided in Section 20.5.1.													
"20.5.1	Risk Assessment"													
A few key risks for the Proposal have been identified by the Proponent that may require further													
consultation and/or discussion with DMAs to ensure the environmental approvals process is not													
delayed. These key risks are discussed in the following sections.													
"20.5.1.1	Significant BIF vegetation associations and communities"													
The DEC has expressed concerns about potential impacts to a specific vegetation association that has													
been identified as being potentially restricted to the greater Macarthur tenement area (Outback													
Ecology 2010a). The vegetation association was described as Eucalyptus stricklandii Low Open													
Woodland over mixed Acacia and Eremophila Tall Shrubland or Frankenia sp. Low Shrubland													
(Outback Ecology 2010a).													
Jan-12													
Page 163 of 180													
Runge Limited													
"However, discussion with Mattiske Consulting Pty Ltd (Mattiske) suggest the extent range of the"													
vegetation association may not be restricted to the Project area as identified by the Level 1 Flora and													
Vegetation Survey (Outback Ecology 2010a) based on the preliminary results of the Autumn Level 2													
"Flora and Vegetation survey and Mattiskes regional data set (Cargill J [Mattiske] 2011, pers. comm."													
27 July 2011). Following the Spring Level 2 Flora and Vegetation survey consultation between the													
"Proponent, Mattiske and the DEC is required to address and agree on the significance of the"													
vegetation association. These discussions will assist the Proponent to understand if additional													
investigations are required as part of the EIA so the approvals process is not significantly delayed.													
"Two PECs also have the potential to occur within the Project area, however, these cannot be"													
confirmed as occurring by Mattiske due to the limited availability of information on the PECs													
regarding species composition and vegetation complexes (Mattiske 2011). Further consultation with													
the DEC on this issue is also required so that potential impacts to these PECs can be assessed and													
addressed by the Proponent if required.													
"20.5.1.2	Malleefowl impact mitigation and management"													
The Malleefowl is a species of State and Commonwealth significance and has been observed within													
"the Project area and across the greater Macarthur tenement area. In terms of project risk, the potential"													
for Commonwealth intervention on this matter is considered of greater significance than State													
involvement.													
It is considered likely based on past and recent projects surrounding the greater Macarthur tenement													
"area (Koolyanobbing Expansion Project [Portman/Cliffs], Parker Range Iron Ore Project [Cazaly"													
"Resources]), that SEWPaC will assess the Proposal as a controlled action. As a condition of the"													
action the Minister may require the Proponent to implement a number of management and mitigation													
actions including the requirement to offset the potential impact by the action.													
"Terrestrial Ecosystems (TES), the appointed subcontractor that conducted the targeted Malleefowl"													
"survey, have recommended an offset strategy which may involve establishing a hatching aviary onsite"													
"to increase the number of regional birds, implementing a program to reduce predator numbers or"													
implementing a combination of both management strategies. TES consider it possible that SEWPaC													
may require additional surveying by the Proponent to establish a baseline knowledge of the local													
"Malleefowl population, in addition to the regional understanding of the population from completed"													
regional surveys. A monitoring program may also be required to measure the success of the approved													
offset program.													
Development of an offset program for Matters of National Environmental Significance (NES) such as													
the Malleefowl can involve an extensive consultation and assessment process with SEWPaC.													
Therefore consultation with SEWPaC to discuss this factor will be sought in November 2011													
following the final report of the targeted Malleefowl survey. The objective of the consultation will be													
"to determine SEWPaCs position on the expected level of assessment, and the level of management"													
required to offset any residual impact on Malleefowl resulting from the Project (if required).													
"20.5.1.3	Short Range Endemics"													
The latest survey results and species observation work suggest that several potential SRE species may													
be restricted to the Project area. The EPA/DEC will be consulted to allow the Proponent to													
understand their current view on the significance of these results and whether this factor is likely to													
trigger assessment of the Project under Part IV of the EP Act.													
It may be advised that additional SRE surveys are commissioned to expand on the current local and													
"regional knowledge of SREs including habitat preferences, and to identify the distribution of potential"													
Jan-12													
Page 164 of 180													
Runge Limited													
SREs outside the Project impact areas. This may reduce the number of potential SREs restricted to													
the Project area and the significance of the impact to this factor negating the requirement for													
assessment of the Project under Part IV of the EP Act.													
"20.5.1.4	Water supply"													
Dust management will require a suitable water supply be found by the Proponent to meet DMP and													
EPA expectations. Hypersaline water is likely to be readily available on site and may be used for dust													
"suppression. However, finding an onsite source of potable water of a suitable quality for human"													
consumption and potential ore processing may be more challenging. The results of the initial phase of													
the water exploration program is discussed in Section 20.1.3.													
"Following the determination of the actual water supply required for the Project, further water"													
exploration programs are likely to continue in 2012.													
It should be noted that Level 1 terrestrial fauna and flora and vegetation surveys will be required as a													
minimum for EIA of a potential pipeline and borefield footprint which are located outside the current													
proposed Project footprint.													
If this aspect of the Proposal still has not been confirmed before the Mining Proposal is submitted to													
"the DMP, a Mining Proposal amendment application may be required once this information and detail"													
becomes available.

21.2 Summary Scope of Work													
The Project execution approach which has been used as a basis for preparing this estimate focuses on													
the establishment of a contractor based mining and haulage operation for the mine site and logistics.													
"The Owner would operate a build, own and operate operation for the processing facility."													
"Construction of the mine site, camp and processing facility would be by contractors. The Owner"													
would supply the necessary conveying infrastructure to transport the product from the processing													
facility to the stockpile. Operations of the facilities would be by owner.													
"The Owner would be responsible for the construction of the accommodation camp, basic headworks"													
"and any infrastructure not typically provided by the operations contractors (e.g. communications, bore"													
fields etc).													
Purpose built haul roads interconnecting the mine site with the Mine Operation Centre (MOC) 1 and													
MOC 2 with the existing Evanston to Menzies road would be constructed by the Owner. For the													
purposes of the Preliminary Economic Assessment the MOC have been estimated to be 2km from the													
Pits. The Owner would also be responsible for the construction of new intersections and upgrade													
works dealing with the existing Evanston to Menzies road to make it fit for purpose when hauling the													
product to the rail siding including bypass around Menzies. Construction of the rail loading facility													
and rail track would be by the Owner.													
All required infrastructure at the Port of Esperance would be in place and the corporate entity running													
"the port, Esperance Ports Sea and Land (EPSL), or yet to be determined third party would recover the"													
cost through an operating cost per tonne rate.

"21.3	Capital Estimate Basis"													
The capital cost estimate has been prepared in line with the Engenium corporate estimating guidelines													
for a Type 1 Scoping Study level estimate. This estimate is to target a predicted accuracy of between													
+/- 30% to 35%.													
All costs are estimated on the basis of the pricing for labour and materials existing in Q4 2011.													
Escalation of costs beyond this date is not included in the capital cost estimate and is to be considered													
within the financial model.													
"The estimate, where possible and where sufficient engineering design and detail exists, has been"													
derived from first principles or from contractor quotations with suitable sensitivity checks and													
benchmarking against recently completed projects in the region. Other estimates are sourced from the													
Engenium estimating database or in-house cost factors derived from projects of similar size and													
"scope, if considered accurate enough for this level of estimate."													
"21.4	Operating Costs"													
The operating cost estimate has been prepared in line with the Engenium corporate estimating													
guidelines for a Type 1 Scoping Study level estimate. This estimate is to target a predicted accuracy													
of between +/- 30% to 35%.													
All costs are estimated on the basis of the pricing for labour and materials existing in Q4 2011.													
Escalation of costs beyond this date is not included.													
"The estimate, where possible and where sufficient engineering design and detail exists, has been"													
derived from contractor quotations with suitable sensitivity checks and benchmarking against recently													
completed projects in the region. Other estimates are sourced from the Engenium estimating database													
"or in-house cost factors derived from projects of similar size and scope, if considered accurate enough"													
for this level of estimate.													
"21.5	Scope of Operations Estimate"													
The operating cost estimate includes all the costs associated with the operation of the project facilities													
from extraction to ship loading.													
The operating strategy used as a basis in this estimate is summarised as follows:													
"	Engage a mining contractor for ore extraction and stockpile at the mine site ROM pads."													
(Contractor Mobilisation and Operations Pre Strip of the mine areas to be included in the													
capital costs).													
"	Build, own and operate (Owner) crushing and screening plant for processing of ore and"													
stockpiling of final product.													
"	Engage a road haulage contractor for ore haulage from the minesite to the rail siding south"													
of Menzies.													
"	Engage a rail haulage contractor to handle a product loading and transport operation from"													
the rail siding to the Port of Esperance.													
"	Use the Ports operations company to manage the material handling and shiploading"													
activities at the Port.

"21.6	Operating Cost Estimate Summary"													
The following Table 55 summarises the operating costs (dry).													
Note: These costs are on annualised average cost. They do not include one off costs such as													
demobilisation or reflect production ramp-up/ramp-down. They are reflective of the 2nd year of													
operation. The rail and port operating costs are inflated by contributions towards the capital for their													
respective upgrades. $10M has been assumed for the rail upgrade and a 20% contribution towards a													
10Mtpa port upgrade (MMLs contribution for 2Mtpa of that upgrade). Refer to the financial model in													
T able 57 for detailed operating costs over the periods of production and operations.

"22	ECONOMIC ANALYSIS"													
The economic analysis in this section are based on mineral resources that are not mineral reserves and													
as such cannot demonstrate economic viability.													
"22.1	Financial Model Assumptions"													
The following are the assumptions relating to the financial model:													
"	Potential ore mining rate of 2 Mt per annum, producing 2 Mt of DSO hematite iron ore per"													
annum (total of 10.5 Mt).													
"	Ave. Stripping Ratio 2.8:1."													
"	Project life of 5 years."													
"	Iron ore price of USD 2.48/dmtu decreasing to USD 1.55/dmtu over LOM."													
"	Exchange rate of 0.96 USD/AUD decreasing to 0.8 USD/AUD over LOM."													
"	Mass recovery of 100%."													
"	55.9% iron content."													
"	6.5% royalty rate increasing to 7.5% over LOM."													
"	50% of the estimated contingency is assumed to be expended."													
The basis for the iron ore price was obtained from CRU. The basis for the price CRU Iron Ore price													
is USD dmt ex-Pilbara. A $5/t penalty per Fe percentage point for grades below 62.5% Fe has been													
estimated. For this Project the penalty would be $33/t for the 55.9% Fe grade. A $3 per tonne penalty													
has also been assumed by the Project as a freight penalty ex-Esperance and an additional $5.35/t for													
the high Sulphur content of the DSO product.													
"22.2	Discounted Cash Flow Analysis"													
A discount cash flow model was used to derive a NPV for the Project. The assumptions used to derive													
this were:													
"	Discount rate of 8% and 10%."													
"	Model over project life of 5 years."													
"	No terminal value has been added to the NPV, reflecting any extension to the plant and/or mine"													
life.													
The summary of the Project pre-tax NPVs for the Project is below in Table 56.

"25	INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS"													
"A Mineral Resource estimate has been compiled for the Macarthur Hematite Project, based upon a total of"													
"819 RC drill holes. Results from these drill holes, and from geological field mapping and observations,"													
provided the basis for the geological interpretations. The Mineral Resource estimate was classified as													
"Indicated and Inferred, required by NI 43-101 and described in the CIM Definition Standards on Mineral"													
Resources and Mineral Reserves. The classification level is based upon an assessment of geological and													
"mineralisation continuity, quality control results from drilling and assaying, and an analysis of available"													
density information.													
The Mineral Resource compiled as part of this report increases the hematite / goethite (H/G) Mineral													
"Resource at the Macarthur Hematite Project, since the previous H/G Mineral Resource estimate was"													
"published (Allen, 2011). The current Mineral Resource for the Macarthur Hematite Project is presented in"

Note: The CSA Mineral Resource was estimated within constraining wireframe solids based on a lower													
cut-off grade of 50% Fe. The resource is quoted from blocks above the specified Fe% cut-off grade.													
Differences may occur due to rounding. Mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have													
demonstrated economic viability.													
The outcropping geology of the Macarthur Hematite Project area is comprised of a combination of un-													
"altered silica rich BIFs and altered, enriched H/G BIFs. The H/G units are the source of Macarthurs H/G"													
Mineral Resources to date and exist largely as a supergene product. Weathering has resulted in the leaching													
"of the majority of the silica from the BIFs, thus producing a rock rich in iron and low in silica. These"													
enriched bands vary from 1m to 30m in true thickness and are largely steeply dipping at 70o-90o. The													
"mineralisation extends along a strike extent of 6000m (Snark), 1,200m (Drabble Downs), 3,200m (Banjo /"													
"Lost World), 3,200m (Central) and 2,200m (Moonshine). Moonshine was excluded from this study due to"

its low grade. Mineralisation has been modelled to a depth of 55m below surface except where closed by													
drilling.													
The classification levels applied to this Mineral Resource are compliant with NI43-101 (2011) and relate to													
"levels of risk built into the model. An Inferred classification carries the highest level of risk, and with regard"													
"to the Snark and Drabble Downs model, the risk is associated with anticipated depth of mineralisation. The"													
current geological interpretation pushes the hematite mineralisation model to a depth of 55m below the													
"topography, unless cut off by a drill hole. This depth has been arbitrarily decided, based upon field"													
"observations by Macarthur geologists, and the experience of the Qualified Person with hematite deposits of"													
"similar style. The risk is that the volume, therefore tonnage of mineralisation modelled, may be over or"													
under estimated in local areas.													
An Indicated classification level is the middle risk classification category (the lowest risk category is													
"Measured); there is higher confidence implied in the geological interpretation, primarily based upon a"													
"greater density of drilling results. The Indicated Mineral Resources typically outcrop, although some of the"													
smaller hematite lenses have been classified as Inferred due to lower density of drilling intercepting these.													
A density value of 2.9t/m3 has been applied to all blocks in the Snark and Drabble Downs Mineral Resource													
estimate. This value was determined following the study of density data from geophysical probing of													
"selected holes, and density measurements derived from diamond core. As discussed in detail in Section"													
"14.2.6.3, there is a marked contrast in mean density values, between diamond core samples and geophysical"													
"probe data. CSA are unwilling to apply a low density value averaging 2.6 t/m3, derived from geophysical"													
"probe data, for the Mineral Resource. This is the same density as for quartz and is lower than the"													
recommended density value applied to volcano-sedimentary lithologies of the Eastern Goldfields.													
"Conversely, CSA believe the average value of 3.0t/m3 derived from billets of diamond core is slightly too"													
"high, based upon discussions with Macarthur geological staff regarding the competency of the mineralised"													
lodes. CSA have decided therefore to take a conservative route and applied a density of 2.9t/m3 for the													
Mineral Resource. CSA strongly recommend further analysis of the probe density data. There is currently a													
"risk associated with the applied value of 2.9t/m3, because the tonnage of the Mineral Resource is directly"													
"related to the density, the other component being volume of the resource model. The Indicated classification"													
level has allowed for some tolerance in this density value; nevertheless the risk must be considered when													
evaluating this Mineral Resource.													
A density value based upon a regression algorithm of estimated Fe% block grades was applied to the													
"Central, Banjo / Lost World and Moonshine Mineral Resource estimates, as discussed in Section 14.3.11."													
"Whittle optimisation was carried out adopting the geotechnical parameters, the costs scenario as"													
estimated for mining component was from internal databases and for all non-mining costs (such as													
crushing and transport) as promulgated by Engenium. The revenue basis was provided by Macarthur													
Minerals Limited. The resulting tonnage within the whittle shells was determined using a 52% Fe													
grade cut-off to achieve a final product at a calcined Fe grade greater than 60%.													
The resulting shells provided a target for mine design. A preliminary pit design was completed for one													
area of the Snark deposit. This resulted in an estimate conversion factor from a whittle shell to a pit													
design (100% of whittle shell tonnes reported to pit design tonnages with a 152% increase in waste													
mining). These factors were then applied to the total whittle shell results providing the following													
estimate of potentially mineable material. Caution must be exercised in adopting these results as the													
basis for them is substantially an inferred resource on which broad mining factors have been applied													
and thus cannot be used in any definitive valuation.													
Only the average grades calculated for these figures have been assessed. It can be seen below that the													
Sulphur grade is high and a discount factor has been applied to the revenue stream to account for this.

"Other impurities such as AI2O3, SiO2 and P are globally within anticipated specifications though on"													
individually pits they may exceed those specifications. Thus some form of blending maybe required.													
At this level of study only high level design work has been completed with no accompanying													
schedule. It is noted from the geological section that of the 24.4Mt of resource almost two thirds													
(15.8Mt) is in the Inferred category of resource and therefore cannot be used in a feasibility study.													
Thus no estimate of Mineral Reserve has been made. A Preliminary Economic Assessment indicates													
the need and suggests the direction for a pre-feasibility study.													
The pits will be spread over a considerable distance of about 25km and hence the crushing plant will													
be moved at least once to keep the raw ore trucking within manageable distances. Operating costs for													
"the mining operation have been built up from first principles, tempered with costs from in-house"													
databases.

"26	RECOMMENDATIONS"													
It is recommended the following actions to increase or maintain the confidence of future Mineral													
Resource estimates:													
"	Construct a deposit scale geological model incorporating lithology, mineralisation,"													
weathering and structural features that locally control the occurrence and location of													
mineralisation. This should be done by Macarthur field geologists in parallel with their													
geological interpretations of drill hole results.													
"	Interpret local geology to model expected depth of mineralisation with a higher degree of"													
"confidence. The current deeper mineralisation is classified as Inferred, which can be upgraded"													
if depth of mineralisation is better understood. This should be done by Macarthur field													
geologists in parallel with their geological interpretations of drill hole results.													
"	Review density data obtained during 2011 from diamond core and geophysical logging, and"													
determine appropriate algorithms to assign density values. This requires dedicated evaluation													
"of currently available results, and preferably requires the geological interpretations and"													
models to be completed.													
"	Maintain field geological procedures with respect to drill rig inspections and sampling"													
"procedures, vetting the maintenance and cleanliness of sample splitters and sample recovery."													
This forms part of Macarthurs Standard Operating Procedure and is not an additional													
requirement.													
"	Monitor the performance of certified reference materials (CRM) and field duplicates"													
immediately upon receipt of assays. This forms part of Macarthurs Standard Operating													
Procedure and is not an additional requirement.													
"	Complete additional drilling in Inferred Mineral Resource areas, to decrease drill hole spacing"													
and increase geological confidence of individual mineralised units. This will require													
"budgeting of money and resources, and will require a time frame of at least twelve months"													
"from initial drill hole planning and budgetary approval, to final receipt of sample assays."													
The study work and engineering effort is sufficiently advanced that it is anticipated that the													
Preliminary Feasibility Study (PFS) could be completed relatively quickly.													
Some areas that would require additional effort during the PFS include:													
"	detail of the Esperance Ports expansion plans and how they impact the Project;"													
"	detail of Brookfield Rails expansion plans and how they impact the Project;"													
"	marketing, products and pricing relevant to the Project;"													
"	additional environmental information that becomes available within the timeframe;"													
"	and update the mining and infrastructure sections of the report based on the improved"													
"understanding of the resource, water supply and geotechnical issues."													
The Definitive Feasibility Study (DFS) is expected to follow the PFS. Preliminary planning for the													
DFS would be undertaken during the PFS.
