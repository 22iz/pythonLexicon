"1.	SUMMARY"																																	
"1.1	Introduction"																																	
"Cap-Ex Iron Ore Ltd. (Cap-Ex) owns a 100% interest, excluding certain royalty interest,"																																	
"in the Block 103 Iron Ore Property (the ""Property""). The Property is located in the"																																	
"Labrador (“Trough”), Newfoundland and Labrador, approximately 30 km northwest from"																																	
"the Town of Schefferville, QC and 1,200 km by air northeast of Montreal, QC. Cap-Ex"																																	
"initiated exploration of the Property in 2011, completing geological mapping, geophysical"																																	
surveys and a diamond drilling program. Subsequently it accumulated more claims via																																	
agreements with third parties and by map staking. Cap-Ex continued diamond drilling in																																	
"2012. Total drilling now stands at 115 drillholes aggregating 28,021 m. Two zones of"																																	
mineralization have been defined on the Property; namely the Northwest Zone and the																																	
"Greenbush Zone. Most of the drilling, including all of the 2012 drilling program, has been"																																	
done to explore and extend the Greenbush Zone.																																	
"Watts, Griffis and McOuat Limited (WGM) produced an NI 43-101 compliant Technical"																																	
"Report, dated March 20, 2013, presenting a Mineral Resource estimate based on the"																																	
aforementioned drill program. Cap-Ex filed the Report on SEDAR (www.sedar.com).																																	
Cap-Ex retained the services of the engineering consulting group BBA Inc. (BBA) to																																	
"complete an NI 43-101 compliant Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA), based on"																																	
"the development of the Block103 deposit, to produce iron ore acid pellets from 16 Mt/y of"																																	
"magnetite concentrate. This Report was prepared at the request of Mr. Graham Harris,"																																	
Chief Executive Officer of the Corporation.																																	
"1.2	Property"																																	
"The Property consists of 10 map staked licenses totalling 291 mineral claims, 7,275 ha."																																	
Six of the 10 licenses were staked by Cap-Ex and the other 4 licenses were acquired																																	
through purchase and sale agreements. The Property is registered to Schefferville Iron																																	
Ore Exploration Corp. (SIOEC). SIOEC was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cap-Ex that																																	
amalgamated with Cap-Ex in September 2012. Cap-Ex Ventures Ltd. changed its name																																	
"to Cap-Ex Iron Ore Ltd., effective March 4, 2013."

"The initial property block, consisting of licence 014603M, was acquired in March 2011"																																	
"from Mandu Resources Ltd. (Mandu), Bedford Resources Partners Inc. (Bedford) and"																																	
743584 Ontario Inc. The vendors retain a royalty on iron ore produced from the property.																																	
Two additional licences (014855M and 014856M) were acquired from Adriana																																	
Resources Inc. (Adriana). Adriana retains a 1% royalty on any production from the																																	
properties.																																	
"License 17130M was acquired in April 2011 from Darrin Hicks, who holds a 2% Royalty,"																																	
"as well as an advanced royalty of $5,000 for a period of 5 years, which is due in April"																																	
2016																																	
"1.3	Previous Work"																																	
The Property was originally part of the holdings of the Iron Ore Company of Canada																																	
"(IOCC). The name, Block 103 is IOCC’s designation for a portion of the Property. An"																																	
adjacent part of the Property is IOCC’s Block 19. The area was first explored and																																	
mapped in 1950 by IOCC. In the 1970s - early 1980s Labrador Mining and Exploration																																	
(LM&E) conducted airborne geophysical surveys covering portions of the property.																																	
"In 2008, Bedford acquired licence 014603M forming the core of the present Property."																																	
"Bedford optioned it to Adriana, and Adriana acquired additional property, namely"																																	
licences 014855M and 014856M contiguous with the original Bedford claims. Adriana																																	
contracted MPX Geophysics Ltd. (MPX) to conduct an airborne magnetic survey. The																																	
survey delineated a northwest striking package of magnetite iron formation. Adriana																																	
made at least one site visit to the property to collect surface samples. In 2010 Adriana																																	
relinquished its option with Bedford and placed the license in 743589 Ontario Inc.																																	
"On January 11, 2011, Cap-Ex contracted Paterson, Grant and Watson Limited (PGW) to"																																	
review the MPX survey data. PGW’s report was issued in February 2011 and Cap-Ex																																	
"completed the option of license 014603M from Mandu, Bedford and 743584 Ontario Inc."

"1.4	Geology and Mineralization"																																	
"The Property is situated in the Churchill Province, of the Labrador Trough (Trough)."																																	
"The Trough, otherwise known as the Labrador-Quebec Fold Belt, extends for more than"																																	
"1,100 km along the eastern margin of the Superior Craton from Ungava Bay to Lake"																																	
"Pletipi, Quebec. The belt is about 100 km wide in its central part and narrows"																																	
considerably to the north and south. Cap-Ex’s Block 103 Property is located north of the																																	
Grenville Front in the Churchill Province where the Trough rocks have been subject to																																	
greenschist or sub-greenschist grade metamorphism and the principal iron formation unit																																	
"is known as the Sokoman Formation. The lithological units of interest on the Property,"																																	
"due to their iron content, are members of the Sokoman."																																	
The Greenbush Zone is made up of iron formations of the Lake Superior-type. This type																																	
of iron formation consists of banded sedimentary rocks comprised principally of bands of																																	
"magnetite and hematite within quartz (chert)-rich rock, with variable amounts of silicate,"																																	
carbonate and sulphide lithofacies. Such iron formations have been the principal sources																																	
of iron throughout the world. Lithofacies that are not highly metamorphosed or altered by																																	
weathering are referred to as taconite. The Block 103 Property iron formations are																																	
examples of this type. Mineralization in the iron formation consists mainly of magnetite																																	
"(Fe3O4) and hematite (Fe2O3) however, some iron also generally occurs in siderite and"																																	
ferro-ankerite and silicates. Iron oxide bands containing concentrations of magnetite																																	
and/or hematite alternate with grey chert of jasper.																																	
"1.5	Exploration and Drilling"																																	
Adriana held an option on a portion of the Property from 2008 to 2010. As far as is																																	
"known, Adriana only performed an airborne magnetic survey and collected 2 samples,"																																	
"labelled A and B, from outcrop for assay and Davis Tube test work. All recent exploration"																																	
and drilling on the Property were completed by Cap-Ex. Cap-Ex’s exploration programs																																	
started in 2011 and consisted largely of drilling to test the geophysical anomalies																																	
"throughout the Property, but also included surface geological mapping and a"																																	
geophysical survey. The 2011 drill program comprised 43 drillholes aggregating																																	
"5,662 m. The results of the 2011 program were viewed as positive."

NI 43-101 Technical Report																																	
CAP-EX

Cap-Ex’s 2012 exploration program on the Property again mostly consisted of diamond																																	
drilling.																																	
The 2012 program focussed on the Greenbush Zone and comprised 72 drillholes																																	
"aggregating 22,359 m. Drilling was completed along grid lines 500 m to 600 m apart."																																	
The distance between holes varied but the hole collars were often less than 200 m apart.																																	
The drilling covered an approximate NW-SE strike length of 4 km by 2.5 km and tested																																	
mineralization to a depth of approximately 450 m vertical.																																	
"DGI Geoscience Inc. (DGI), in support of the 2012 drilling program, completed borehole"																																	
geophysics and gyro attitude surveying on a selection of the accessible drillholes. The																																	
"geophysical surveying included in-situ physical properties, including rock density and an"																																	
optical televiewer to acquire rock/structure orientation information.																																	
"1.6	Logging, Sampling and Assaying"																																	
Core logging for Cap-Ex’s 2011 drilling programs included only descriptive logging. For																																	
"its 2012 program Rock Quality Designation (RQD), core recovery, fracture data and core"																																	
photography supplemented descriptive logging.																																	
"Sample intervals were determined on a geological basis, as selected by the drill"																																	
"geologist during logging, and marked out on the drill core. Core was sampled"																																	
"systematically with sample lengths ranging from 1 to 5 m, averaging close to 3 m. All"																																	
"rock estimated to contain abundant iron oxide was sampled, as well as bracket samples"																																	
of visually low-grade core.																																	
Samples for the 2011 program were shipped to SGS-Lakefield Minerals Services (SGS-																																	
"Lakefield) in Lakefield, Ontario for sample preparation and assay. For the early part of"																																	
"the 2012 program, samples were routinely shipped to Acme Analytical Laboratories"																																	
"(Vancouver) Ltd. (AcmeLabs) but, for the latter parts of the program, the samples were"																																	
shipped to SGS-Lakefield.

"For both programs, samples were routinely analyzed for major element Whole Rock"																																	
(WR) oxides by X-Ray Florescence spectroscopy (XRF). FeO was determined by																																	
titration and magnetic iron or magnetite was determined by Satmagan. In-field QA/QC																																	
for the 2011 program included core Duplicates. For the 2012 program Blanks and																																	
Certified Reference Standards were inserted into the sample stream going to the lab and																																	
quarter core Duplicates were also collected and assayed.																																	
"In 2011, Inspectorate’s Vancouver laboratory (Inspectorate) was used as a Secondary"																																	
assay lab to complete Check assaying on a selection of samples previously assayed by																																	
"SGS-Lakefield. For the 2012, program samples were exchanged between the two"																																	
"Primary labs: SGS-Lakefield and AcmeLabs. That is, a selection of samples originally"																																	
prepared and analysed at SGS-Lakefield were Check assayed at AcmeLabs and a																																	
selection of samples originally prepared at AcmeLabs were Check assayed at SGS-																																	
Lakefield.																																	
"1.7	Data Corroboration"																																	
"WGM Senior Associate Geologist Richard Risto, P.Geo., visited the Property once in"																																	
2012 at the conclusion of the drilling program. The initial visit was to initiate the project																																	
review process. Mr. Risto reviewed drilling completed to date and the status of deposit																																	
"interpretation, logging and sampling procedures. He viewed drilling sites to validate their"																																	
locations and collected Independent samples for assay.																																	
"1.8	Adjacent Properties"																																	
The Property is located immediately east of the Howells River system. The LabMag																																	
Deposit of Tata Steel Global Minerals Holdings Pte Ltd. (Tata Steel) /and New																																	
Millennium Iron Corp. (New Millennium) is located on the southwest of Howells River.																																	
Other taconite iron deposits are also located in the area.																																	
"1.9	Mineral Processing and Metallurgical Testing"																																	
An initial testwork program was developed and managed by BBA to perform a																																	
preliminary metallurgical characterization of the Greenbush Zone mineralization as part																																	
of the project PEA. The objective of the testwork program was to evaluate the ore’s

amenability to concentration and production of a magnetite concentrate suitable for																																	
pelletization. At the moment of designing the testwork program and given the preliminary																																	
"understanding of the deposit at that time, the deposit was divided into five sectors for"																																	
individual characterization. These five sectors were:																																	
"?	North Upper-Horizon (NUH)"																																	
"?	East Upper-Horizon (EUH)"																																	
"?	East Lower-Horizon (ELH)"																																	
"?	West Upper-Horizon (WUH)"																																	
"?	West Lower-Horizon (WLH)"																																	
Each sector was represented for grindability and metallurgical testing by drill cores and																																	
"composite samples, created using assay rejects from the 2011 and 2012 drilling"																																	
campaigns. The overall testwork program was done at two facilities: in COREM																																	
"laboratories (COREM) in Quebec City, Quebec and SGS Lakefield (SGS) in Lakefield,"																																	
"Ontario. The overall testwork program included whole rock analysis (WRA), Satmagan"																																	
"(SAT), Davis Tube (DT), wet and dry low intensity magnetic separation (LIMS), heavy"																																	
"liquid separation (HLS), mineral liberation analysis (MLA), modified Bond Work index"																																	
(BWi) determination and SMC testing®. Mineral liberation analysis showed the presence																																	
"of finely disseminated hematite. However, the recovery of this hematite was not included"																																	
in this study and only magnetic recovery was considered.																																	
When possible and in accordance with the mine plan developed for the first thirty years																																	
"of operation, only the test results from the northern and eastern sectors of the overall"																																	
"deposit were considered. Based on the laboratory test results and their interpretation,"																																	
metallurgical performance for the production of a magnetite concentrate and pellet																																	
reflecting the northern and eastern sectors has thus been projected as follows:

"1.10	Mineral Resource Estimate"																																	
"Following the completion of additional drilling during 2012, Cap-Ex prepared an initial"																																	
Mineral Resource estimate for the Block 103 Property. WGM was retained by Cap-Ex to																																	
audit this in-house estimate. Information used for this estimate was based on all drillhole																																	
data that was completed by the end of 2012 and included a minor amount of drilling from																																	
the previous year. The current Mineral Resource estimate was completed only on an																																	
"area in the Property known as the Greenbush Zone, where the drilling density and"																																	
confidence was sufficient to define the resource.																																	
"The current Mineral Resource is categorized as Inferred based on drillhole spacing, data"																																	
quality (and confidence) and search ellipse distances. The Mineral Resources are																																	
reported above 100 m elevation level (about 500 m from surface) and are summarized in																																	
the table below.

"Due to the uncertainty that may be attached to Inferred Mineral Resources, it"																																	
cannot be assumed that all or any part of an Inferred Mineral Resource will be																																	
upgraded to an Indicated or Measured Mineral Resource as a result of continued																																	
exploration. Confidence in the estimate is insufficient to allow the meaningful																																	
application of technical and economic parameters or to enable an evaluation																																	
of economic viability worthy of public disclosure. Inferred Mineral Resources																																	
must be excluded from estimates forming the basis of feasibility or other economic																																	
studies.																																	
"The Mineral Resource estimate for the Block 103 Project, Greenbush Zone, was"																																	
completed in Gemcom™ using block sizes of 100 m x 30 m x 10 m and is based on																																	
"results from 81 diamond drillholes totalling 23,735 m. These holes were fairly regularly"																																	
"dispersed in the iron mineralization along approximately 4,000 m of strike length and a"																																	
"range of 2,000 to 2,500 m of width for the north-central portion of the Property. The main"																																	
objective of the 2012 drilling campaign was to identify potential mineralized horizons for																																	
the purpose of modelling and Mineral Resource estimation and to ensure that the																																	
drillholes penetrated the entire stratigraphic package. Most of the holes from the 2011																																	
drilling program (mainly to the SE and NW of the Greenbush area) were excluded as

they were often aborted in the upper mineralized horizons before reaching the																																	
non-mineralized basal sedimentary unit.																																	
"The drillhole spacing, i.e. cross section spacing, along the strike of the mineralized"																																	
zones is approximately 600 m and the hole spacing on the cross sections varied from																																	
"60 m to about 250 m, with vertical depths ranging from of 50 m to 400 m. Some cross"																																	
sections have geological interpretations down to the 100 m level (about 500 m below																																	
"surface), however; no Mineral Resources are defined below the 100 m level. The"																																	
mineralized zones in the south parts of the Greenbush Zone were drilled with tighter																																	
spacing within the cross sections (denser drilling pattern across the mineralized zones)																																	
"to allow better definition of the geological and structural interpretations; however, the NW"																																	
part of the Greenbush Zone (north of Cross Section 10960N) has wider spaced drilling																																	
along the sections (up to 600 m spacing) from the previous exploration program. The																																	
continuity of the mineralization gave enough confidence to extend the interpretation and																																	
resources up to a 600 m distance along strike and about 400 m on the ends/edges and																																	
at depth. As a further refinement to the boundaries defining the potentially economic																																	
"mineralization, a modeling cutoff grade for the horizons was set at 10% magFe; the"																																	
boundaries were adjusted based on this 10% threshold for the 3-D wireframes for the																																	
Mineral Resource estimate.																																	
"In order to carry out the Mineral Resource grade interpolation, a set of equal length"																																	
composites of 3 m was generated from the raw drillhole intervals. Regular down-the-																																	
drillhole compositing was used. The statistical distribution of the %TFe and %magFe																																	
samples showed good normal distributions and no grade capping was used in the																																	
Mineral Resource estimation.																																	
Cap-Ex completed SG determinations on selected pulps from 315 routine samples at																																	
SGS-Lakefield using the gas comparison pycnometer method. WGM assessed the																																	
relationship of SG to %TFe on available samples and a best fit line based on available																																	
laboratory measured SG data and %TFe was chosen to convert volumes to tonnes for																																	
the current Mineral Resource estimate. This best fit correlation line																																	
"(%TFe x 0.0279 + 2.5695, was used for the current Mineral Resource estimate to create"

a variable density model to estimate tonnage. This formula reflects WGM’s experience																																	
with other iron ore deposits and it has been shown that SG has excellent correlation with																																	
"%TFe, as is typical with these types of deposits. Using the variable density model, a"																																	
30% TFe gives a SG of approximately 3.40. Cap-Ex used an ID2 interpolation method																																	
and the results of the interpolation approximated the average grade of all the composites																																	
used for the estimate and WGM is of the opinion that ID interpolation is appropriate.																																	
The structural geology and geometry of the sub-members and repeating stratigraphic																																	
packages are not completely understood due to the current lack of drilling. In a general																																	
"sense, the continuity of the mineralization was quite good; however, the internal"																																	
continuity of some sub-members and some waste units is poorly understood because of																																	
the folding/geometric complexity and thrusting. WGM was of the opinion that extending																																	
the geological interpretation beyond the more densely drilled parts of the deposit was																																	
"appropriate at this lower level of confidence, as long as there was supporting data from"																																	
adjacent sections. All the Mineral Resources for the Block 103 Property were classified																																	
as Inferred and the average distance (from a Distance Model created by WGM) for the																																	
resources was approximately 165 m.																																	
Additional drilling is required to get a better understanding of the complex structural																																	
"geology, particularly in the area where folding and thrusting occur together, as it can"																																	
"lead to ambiguous interpretations. However, after more drilling is completed during the"																																	
"next phase of exploration, the modelling will be further refined based on a better"																																	
understanding of the structural geology and the importance of differentiating the sub-																																	
"members and possibly to better control grade distribution by invoking more ""hard"																																	
boundaries”.

"1.20.2	Metallurgy and Ore Processing"																																	
The testwork program undertaken in this PEA Study was aimed at establishing a																																	
"baseline characterization of the mineralogy, metallurgy and grindability of the Block 103"																																	
deposit. The testwork program is typical for taconite type ore.																																	
"At the early stages of the PEA, a sample selection and sample compositing strategy was"																																	
"developed in collaboration with the Cap-Ex geology team, based on the limited"																																	
understanding of the deposit at that time. The deposit was classified into five main																																	
"sectors, as follows, based on drill core material available for sample compositing:"

"2.1	General"																																	
"Cap-Ex Iron Ore Ltd. (Cap-Ex) owns a 100% interest, excluding certain royalty interests,"																																	
"in the Block 103 iron ore Property (the ""Property). The Property is located in the"																																	
"Labrador (“Trough”), Newfoundland and Labrador, approximately 30 km northwest of the"																																	
"town of Schefferville, Quebec and 1,200 km by air northeast of Montreal, QC. The"																																	
Property consists of 14 map-staked licenses totalling 831 mineral claims aggregating																																	
"20,775 ha. Ten of the 14 licenses were staked by Cap-Ex. The other four (4) licenses"																																	
were acquired through purchase and sale agreements. Further details are provided in																																	
Chapter 4 of this Report.																																	
"Cap-Ex initiated exploration of the Property in 2011 and completed geological mapping,"																																	
geophysical surveys and a diamond drilling program comprising 43 drillholes																																	
"aggregating 5,662 m. Cap-Ex continued diamond drilling in 2012. The 2012 program"																																	
"comprised 72 drillholes aggregating 22,359 m. Two (2) zones of mineralization, the"																																	
"Northwest Zone and the Greenbush Zone, have been identified on the Property. Most of"																																	
the drilling to date has been done to explore and define the Greenbush Zone towards																																	
completing a Mineral Resource estimate. Mineralization is magnetite/hematite taconite.																																	
"Prior to Cap-Ex’s acquisition, Adriana Resources Inc. (Adriana) held an option on the"																																	
Property. Adriana completed an airborne geophysical survey over a portion of the																																	
Property and collected and analysed two samples. Some older historical exploration																																	
"results for the Property are available but, except for geological mapping, these appear to"																																	
be of limited value.

"4.	PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION"																																	
"4.1	Property Location"																																	
The Property is located in western Labrador and is approximately 30 km northwest from																																	
"the town of Schefferville, Quebec. The Property consists of 10 contiguous map-staked"																																	
"licenses totalling 291 mineral claims of 7,275 ha in NTS map areas 23O/03, 23J/10,"																																	
23J/11 and 23J/14. It is centred at approximately 54°58’N latitude and 67°14’W																																	
longitude. Cap-Ex holds other property in the same area.																																	
"4.2	Property Description and Ownership"																																	
"In the claim system registry of the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador, the"																																	
Property is registered to Schefferville Iron Ore Exploration Corp. (SIOEC). SIOEC was																																	
"originally a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cap-Ex, however, effective September 2012 was"																																	
amalgamated with Cap-Ex.																																	
The Crown holds all surface rights in the region. Cap-Ex recognizes that four aboriginal																																	
"communities have asserted land claims, or in the case of the Innu Nation, have"																																	
"negotiated an AIP, and that the exploration activity and future development may affect"																																	
the asserted or negotiated rights of each of these communities.																																	
Table 4-1 summarizes the respective anniversary dates and report due dates for the																																	
10 licenses comprising the Property.																																	
The Property land holdings are depicted on Figure 4-1.																																	
"The Property has not been legally surveyed, but the licences were map-staked and are"																																	
"defined by UTM coordinates, so the Property location is accurate. Minor location"																																	
discrepancies can however occur due to different datum. The licences are defined by																																	
NAD27 UTM datum and various work components are NAD83 or NAD84 datum and the																																	
relationship between NAD27 and the later systems is not completely defined for the																																	
region.

PHYSIOGRAPHY																																	
"5.1	Access"																																	
"The Property is accessible from Schefferville, Quebec (see Figures 5-1 and 5-2). The"																																	
Property is approximately 30 km northwest of the town and is traversed by gravel roads																																	
that access New Millennium Iron Corp. (New Millennium) and Labrador Iron Mines																																	
Limited (LIM) properties. There is no road access to Schefferville from the population																																	
centres of Quebec or Labrador. There is daily scheduled air service between																																	
"Schefferville and Wabush or Sept-lles and from there to Quebec City, Montreal and"																																	
beyond. There is once-a-week round-trip train service for passengers and freight																																	
"between Schefferville and Sept-lles, which also provides service to Labrador West."																																	
"5.2	Climate"																																	
The climate in the region is typical of north-central Quebec/western Labrador. Daily																																	
"average temperatures exceed 0°C for only five months of the year. Winters are harsh,"																																	
"lasting about six to seven months, with heavy snow from December through April. Daily"																																	
mean temperatures in Schefferville in January average -24.1°C. Precipitation in the																																	
"Schefferville area includes more than 50 cm of snowfall for each of November,"																																	
December and January. Summers are generally cool and wet with the wettest month of																																	
"summer being July with an average rainfall of 106.8 mm. Extended day-light, however,"																																	
enhances the summer work-day period. Early and late-winter conditions are acceptable																																	
for ground geophysical surveys and drilling operations.																																	
"5.3	Physiography"																																	
The topography of the Schefferville area is bedrock controlled with elevation varying																																	
between 500 m and 700 m above sea level. The terrain is generally gently rolling to flat																																	
with relief of approximately 50 m to 100 m. Topographic highs are normally created by																																	
"more resistive iron formation, quartzites, cherts and silicified units with the lower areas"																																	
corresponding to siltstones and shales.																																	
The Project is within the Atlantic watershed. The area is all part of the northern extents																																	
"of the boreal forest. Conifers, low shrubs and lichens are dominant."

The area is covered by a thin veneer of till composed of glacial and glacial fluvial																																	
sediments. The till is composed of sandy gravels preserved within topographic lows.																																	
"5.4	Local Resources and Infrastructure"																																	
Schefferville with a population of approximately 250 non-native residents is an																																	
"incorporated municipality in the Province of Quebec, and has a number of new buildings,"																																	
"including medical clinics, a recreation centre and churches, and houses. The contiguous"																																	
Matimekosh community has approximately 700 members of the Nation Innu																																	
Matimekosh-Lac John.																																	
"The economy of Schefferville is based on hunting and fishing, tourism and public service"																																	
"administration. In addition to the hunting and fishing outfitters, the population of the town"																																	
"consists mainly of motel, store and flying service operators, teachers, retired families"																																	
and support staff for the town services.																																	
A skilled labour force is accessible from other parts of Newfoundland and Labrador and																																	
Quebec. Modern Canadian mining operations are very commuter friendly with labour																																	
travelling from all parts of Canada to satisfy labour needs.																																	
"The region is served by an airport with a 2,000 m runway capable of handling jet aircraft."																																	
"Scheduled air service is available to Montreal, Wabush and Sept-lles, Quebec."																																	
"Rail service to Schefferville is provided by Tshiuetin Rail Transportation Inc. (TRT),"																																	
"which is owned in equal parts by the Naskapi Nation of Kawawachikamach, the Nation"

"6.	HISTORY"																																	
"6.1	General"																																	
"The historical descriptions presented are believed to be generally accurate, but have not"																																	
been independently verified.																																	
The first substantial exploration in the Labrador Trough commenced in the late 1930s																																	
when Labrador Mining and Exploration company Limited (LM&E) acquired large mineral																																	
"concessions to explore for base and precious metals (Neal, 2001). In 1945, Hollinger"																																	
Gold Mines bought control of LM&E and formed Hollinger North Shore Exploration																																	
Company Limited (Hollinger). M.A. Hanna Company of Cleveland joined Hollinger and																																	
Hanna was joined by other steel companies forming the Iron Ore Company of Canada																																	
(IOCC). The mining and shipping of iron ore in the Schefferville area commenced in																																	
1954 under the management of the IOCC. The exploration and mining of the Direct																																	
Shipping Ore (DSO) deposits at Schefferville ceased in 1982 after production of																																	
"approximately 250 million tons of ore. IOCC’s focus was the DSO deposits, but some"																																	
exploration of taconite mineralization in the Howells River area was also undertaken.																																	
"After the cessation of production, the mineral concessions reverted to the Crown. In"																																	
"recent years with the increase in demand for iron and steel worldwide, iron ore prices"																																	
have increased and exploration and development activity in the Schefferville area has																																	
also been steadily on the rise. The core of the current Property was IOCC’s Block 103;																																	
IOCC referred to the property as Block 103. A part was also IOCC’s Block 19.																																	
"In 1950, IOCC (Perrault, 1950 - Labrador Geofile 023J/0009) completed a 1,000 foot-"																																	
spaced geological mapping program that covered parts of the present claim block and																																	
identified the various lithologies present. No sampling was reported.																																	
"In 1971, IOCC completed airborne electromagnetic and magnetic surveys over a"																																	
"number of areas, including parts of Block 103, and used the data acquired to estimate"																																	
"mineral resources. One of these mineral resource areas, Block 8, is covered by the"																																	
"present claims (Hetu, 1972 - Geofile 023J/0095)."

"In 1978, IOCC completed a ground magnetic and geological survey in the southwest"																																	
portion of Block 103. Geophysics and geological mapping was competed along 500-foot																																	
"spaced lines (Stubbins, 1978 - Geofile 23J/14/196)."																																	
"In 1980, LM&E and IOCC completed a helicopter magnetic, electromagnetic and"																																	
"radiometric survey over Block 103 (Grant, 1980 - Geofile LAB/0564)."																																	
"In 2008, Bedford acquired license 014603M to cover an airborne magnetic anomaly."																																	
"Subsequently, the property was optioned to Adriana and became known as the Bedford"																																	
Iron Prospect.																																	
"In March 2008, Adriana map staked a total of 82 additional claims in two licenses,"																																	
"014855M and 014856M, contiguous with the original Bedford property. It subsequently"																																	
contracted MPX Geophysics Ltd. (MPX Geophysics) to conduct an airborne geophysical																																	
survey of the property. The helicopter-borne survey comprised 670 line-km of surveying																																	
at 100 m spaced lines with a nominal terrain clearance of 50 m. The airborne survey																																	
identified a number of linear magnetic trends that correspond to previously mapped																																	
"magnetite iron formation. Adriana collected two samples from the property, labelled A"																																	
and B. These samples were submitted to SGS-Lakefield for Head assay and Davis Tube																																	
testwork. Sample A assayed 35.7 % TFe; Sample B assayed 18.4 % TFe. WGM is not																																	
"aware of any other work completed by Adriana. In 2010, Adriana relinquished license"																																	
014603M and it was transferred to 743589 Ontario Inc.																																	
"In 2010, or early 2011 the property was offered to Cap-Ex. Cap-Ex contracted Paterson,"																																	
Grant and Watson Ltd. (PGW) to review MPX’s survey results. PGW completed a																																	
"reprocessing of the survey data. PGW’s report, dated February 19, 2011, was titled:"																																	
"“Interpretation of Airborne Magnetic Data for Iron Ore Deposits, Bedford 103 Block,"																																	
Northwest Labrador’.																																	
"In January 2011, Cap-Ex entered into an agreement to acquire the property from Mandu,"																																	
"Bedford and 743584 Ontario Inc. In March 2013, Cap-Ex renounced claims: 19940M,"

communications with Cap-Ex for the following geological descriptions.																																	
"7.1	Regional, Local and Property Geology"																																	
"7.1.1	Regional Geology"																																	
"The Property is situated in the Churchill Structural Province, close to the western margin"																																	
"of the Trough, adjacent to Archean basement gneiss, as indicated in Figure 7-1. The"																																	
"Trough, otherwise known as the Labrador-Quebec Fold Belt, extends for more than"																																	
"1,200 km along the eastern margin of the Superior Craton, from Ungava Bay to Lake"																																	
"Pletipi, Quebec, near Lac Manicouagan. The belt is about 100 km wide in its central part"																																	
and narrows considerably to the north and south.																																	
"The Trough comprises a sequence of Proterozoic sedimentary rocks, including iron"																																	
"formation, volcanic rocks and mafic intrusions. The southern part of the Trough is"																																	
"crossed by the Grenville Front, representing a metamorphic fold-thrust belt in which the"																																	
Archean basement and Early Proterozoic platformal cover were thrust north-westwards																																	
across the southern portion of the southern margin of the North American Craton during																																	
"the 1,000 Ma Grenvillian Orogeny (Brown, Rivers, and Calon, 1992). Trough rocks in the"																																	
Grenville Province are highly metamorphosed and complexly folded. Iron deposits in the																																	
"Gagnon Terrane, Grenville part of the Trough, include Lac Jeannine, Fire Lake, Mont-"																																	
"Wright, Mont-Reed, and Bloom Lake in the Manicouagan-Fermont area, and the Luce,"																																	
Humphrey and Scully deposits in the Wabush-Labrador City area. The high-grade																																	
metamorphism of the Grenville Province is responsible for re-crystallization of both iron																																	
"oxides and silica in primary iron formation, producing coarse-grained sugary quartz,"																																	
"magnetite, and specular hematite schists (meta-taconites) that are of improved quality"																																	
for concentration and processing.

"7.1.2	Property Geology"																																	
The Property area was mapped initially by Perrault in 1950 for IOCC and additional work																																	
was done by LM&E. The area has also been the subject of several research papers by																																	
Klein and Fink in 1976 and 1977. Wardle (1981) recompiled the geology of the area																																	
using a number of sources including IOCC and LM&E. Wardle’s work resulted in Map																																	
"85-2: “Geology of the South-Central Labrador Trough"" and Report 79-1 “Geology of the"																																	
"Westernmost part of the Labrador Trough"". Figure 7-3 is an enlarged portion of"																																	
"Figure 7-1, showing the section of the Property where the Mineral Resources are"																																	
located. Figures 7-1 and 7-3 are both based on Wardle’s map.																																	
"The Property geology interpretation was assembled by Cap-Ex from historic work,"																																	
reconnaissance geological mapping in 2011 and 2012 on scattered outcrops (the																																	
northwestern part of the Property and the area west of Howell’s River has very few																																	
"outcrops), diamond drilling and airborne geophysical surveys. Diamond drilling provided"																																	
the densest data and allowed the use of the Fink stratigraphic column in some detail. All																																	
of the 2011 and 2012 drilling is shown in Figure 7-4. Figures 7-5 to 7-7 also show the																																	
"drillholes, magnetic and gravity responses from Cap-Ex’s airborne geophysics surveys"																																	
and the Greenbush Mineral Resource area. Interpretations from drill cross sections were																																	
projected to surface and compared with outcrops. Cap-Ex used these sources of data																																	
"together, to build a coherent interpretation. Figures 7-8 and 7-9 show the interpreted"																																	
geology of the Mineral Resource area on two type cross sections; a part of the																																	
Greenbush Zone is largely based on drillhole interpretation.																																	
"The Property is underlain by a sequence of northwest-southeast trending, greenschist"																																	
"facies folded and faulted, Ferriman Group that includes the sequence from Wishart,"																																	
through the Sokoman and into the Menihek Formations. Some Cycle 1 rocks (Doly																																	
"Formation) may also be present, but not yet clearly documented. The Property is mainly"																																	
underlain by Sokoman Formation at subsurface. A portion of Menihek Formation shales																																	
"at subsurface. The Sokoman Formation includes iron oxide, iron carbonate and iron"																																	
"silicate facies, and hosts the iron oxide deposits."

Cap-Ex’s mapping and core logging protocol classified rock units according to the																																	
member or sub-member stratigraphy outlined in Table 7-1. Cap-Ex calls these units																																	
"Members. Cap-Ex also used rock type codes based on the percentage of magnetite,"																																	
"hematite, silicate and carbonate, i.e., the composition codes. Table 7-2 lists the"																																	
"composition codes used by Cap-Ex. Essentially, rocks with codes that start with ""H”"																																	
"or ""M” are dominated by hematite or magnetite, with magnetite and/or hematite greater"																																	
"than 20% by volume of the lithology. ""L” at the start of a code means Lean; this is iron"																																	
formation that is relatively low in hematite and/or magnetite (magnetic Fe + hematitic Fe																																	
"between 10% and 20%). ""SIF” is Silicate Iron Formation; SIF is iron formation where"																																	
"most of the iron present is in silicates, rather than oxides, i.e., neither magnetite nor"																																	
hematite.

of the same stratigraphy. Figures 7-1 & 7-3 to 7-7 (shown previously) show the Stakit																																	
"Lake Fault, a regional thrust structure over 150 km long, separating the Tamarack LTZ"																																	
to the west from the Schefferville LTZ to the east. Another prominent thrust fault striking																																	
"northwest lies along the northwestern edge of the Property, parallel the Stakit River"																																	
"Fault, but within the Schefferville LTZ. Iron-oxide bearing Sokoman Formation lies on"																																	
both sides of this fault. Most of the northern portion of the Property is underlain by the																																	
Ferriman Group rocks in the Schefferville LTZ.

CAP-EX

Most of the Property is underlain by formations in the Schefferville LTZ. From drillhole																																	
"and geophysical interpretation, the Schefferville LTZ on the Property is characterized by"																																	
"sequences of inclined, imbricate, Ferriman Group rocks, stacked by folding and thrust"																																	
"faulting. The Trans-Hudsonian compression is believed to have lead, initially, to open"																																	
"folding, and then progressed to a series of listric thrust fault sheets with steeper dips"																																	
"near surface, flattening to nearly horizontal as they merge to a basal decollement fault"																																	
plane about 500 m below surface. The thrust faults are marked by healed cataclastic																																	
"faults with angular clasts in cemented (""healed”) hard matrix; the zones range from 0.15"																																	
"to 1.5 m wide. Later gouge-filled faults show a secondary movement, but these appear"																																	
to have less displacement; occasionally they occur in the healed cataclastic fault zones.																																	
The multiple thrust faults stacked and juxtaposed the Sokoman and adjacent strata so																																	
that there are repetitions of the iron oxide members adjacent to each other. Menihek																																	
Formation may be adjacent to Wishart and members in the Sokoman Formation may be																																	
missing or repeated. Zajac (1974) estimates that the thrust faults shortened the basin by																																	
"28-35%, but this may be understated."																																	
"In contrast to the structural complexity prevalent in the Schefferville LTZ, the Sokoman"																																	
Formations in the Tamarack LTZ dips uniformly and gently with 5°-12° dips to the NE.																																	
"On the Property, drillholes DDH103-11 through 103-16 penetrate this stratigraphy west"																																	
"of Howell’s River, which occupied the Stakit Lake Fault trace."																																	
"7.2	Mineralization"																																	
Mineralization of economic interest on the Property is magnetite-rich oxide facies iron																																	
"formation. The oxide iron formation (""OIF"") consists mainly of semi-massive bands, or"																																	
"layers, and disseminations of magnetite (Fe3O4) and/or hematite (Fe2O3). Some iron also"																																	
invariably occurs in siderite and ferro-ankerite and iron-bearing silicates. Iron oxide																																	
bands containing concentrations of magnetite and/or hematite alternate with grey chert																																	
or jasper. Where silicate or carbonate becomes more prevalent than magnetite and/or																																	
"hematite, the rock is SIF and/or silicate-carbonate iron formation and its variants. SIF"																																	
"consists mainly of amphibole and chert, often associated with carbonate (often iron"																																	
carbonate) and can contain magnetite or hematite in minor amounts. Where carbonate

Jun-13																																	
Cap-Ex Iron Ore Ltd.																																	
NI 43-101 Technical Report																																	
CAP-EX

"becomes more prevalent, the rock is named silicate-carbonate or carbonate-silicate iron"																																	
"formation, but in practice, infinite variations exist between the OIF and silicate-carbonate"																																	
iron formation composition end members (see Table 7-2). SIF and its variants and lean																																	
iron formation are also often interbedded with OIF.																																	
Two zones of mineralization have been defined on the Property. The two zones of																																	
"mineralization are the Greenbush Zone, located near Greenbush Lake, and the"																																	
"Northwest Zone, named as such because of its location along the northwest margin of"																																	
the Property.																																	
"7.2.1	The Greenbush Zone"																																	
"The Greenbush Zone is defined as a portion of the Sokoman sequence, adjacent to"																																	
"Greenbush Lake, and was the focus for most of the 2011 and 2012 drilling program. As"																																	
"currently defined, the Greenbush Zone is approximately 10 km long NW-SE and 5 km"																																	
wide SW-NE and encompasses the area of the present Mineral Resource estimate (see																																	
Figures 7-1 & 7-3 to 7-7). The Sokoman and associated formations show a similar																																	
"stratigraphic pattern as seen to the west and described, with some local variations, in"																																	
"Klein and Fink (1976), but multiple thrust faults (more than 12 have been interpreted by"																																	
Cap-Ex within the drilled volume) have stacked Sokoman members to build a volume in																																	
"excess of 500 vertical metres, compared to the normal ~125 m thickness of the"																																	
Sokoman Formation. Various slices can contain any parts of the sequence that include																																	
"Wishart, Ruth or Menihek, along with iron formation, thus creating sequences including"																																	
"iron formation and internal waste. The beds within a fault slice show NE dips, steeper in"																																	
"upper levels (~35°-45°), flattening at depth to less than 15°, which is consistent with"																																	
multiple listric thrusts originating from the northeast. The mineralogy and grade are																																	
"essentially the same throughout the fault slices, i.e., the same overall group of sub-"																																	
members is repeated in whole or in part.																																	
"The limits of the Greenbush Zone are not completely understood or outlined yet, and this"																																	
"zone is only defined by sufficient drilling density in the Mineral Resource area, which"																																	
represents only a portion of the total volume of potentially economically significant iron																																	
oxide on the Property.

"Greenbush Zone, showing the tectonically stacked slices comprising Sokoman and"

Figures 7-8 and 7-9 (shown previously) are representative drill vertical cross sections																																	
through the Greenbush Zone. The cross sections show the individual stacked northeast																																	
dipping slices include various components of the Menihek to Wishart sequence. The																																	
"slices have names assigned based on location, rather than lithological composition,"																																	
because each contains sequences of various members and formations that repeat from																																	
slice to slice.																																	
"7.2.2	The Northwest Zone"																																	
"The Northwest Zone lies west of the Stakit Lake Fault, west of Howell’s River, where six"																																	
"2011 drillholes (103-11 to 103-17, one drillhole is missing) encountered a single"																																	
"sequence of typical Sokoman iron formation. In this area, the Sokoman subcrops or lies"																																	
beneath a veneer of Menihek Formation. The vertical holes consistently showed the																																	
rocks dip gently (~10°) to the northeast. No evidence of fault repetition was noted. This																																	
area lies on strike trend between New Millennium’s LabMag deposit (to the southeast)																																	
"and KeMag deposit (to the northwest). The entire zone, including all three deposits, is"																																	
likely a continuous zone with varying amounts of iron oxide.																																	
"7.2.3	Mineralization by Rock Type and Specific Gravity"																																	
Mineralization by Rock Type:																																	
Table 7-3 provides average composition of rock types derived from the 2011 and 2012																																	
"drill core sample assays for the Greenbush Zone. In this table, the estimates of %Fe in"

distribution of Fe++ and Fe+++ to magnetite was done assuming the iron in magnetite is																																	
"33.3% Fe++ and 66.6% Fe+++. The estimation method also assumes all iron in silicates,"																																	
carbonates and sulphides is Fe++ and there are no other iron oxide species present in																																	
"the mineralization, to a significant extent, other than hematite and magnetite. This latter"																																	
assumption is believed to be substantially true. Where extensive weathering is prevalent

"magnetite (determined from Satmagan) and the iron from the FeOTotal analysis, in excess"																																	
"of what can be attributed to the iron in the magnetite, from %TFe, and then restating this"																																	
"excess iron as hematitic Fe, as below:"

have no rock type assigned. The reason being the Chem rock type classification has not																																	
been extended to the non-iron ore lithologies. WGM would have preferred to use the																																	
"rock types assigned during logging, but the logging rock types in the Project database"																																	
are not completely consistent and contain a mixture of composition and stratigraphic																																	
"codes. In WGM’s opinion, these codes should be made more consistent."																																	
Rocks classified as MHIF (magnetite-hematite formation) and MIF (magnetite iron																																	
"formation) are shaded and have the best mineralization, as they contain the most"																																	
"magnetite. The rock codes starting with ""H” indicate hematite dominant iron formation."																																	
"As appropriate, %hmFe for these rocks are higher than for magnetite dominant iron"																																	
"formation. TFe is high for these rocks, however, they contain moderate to low magnetite."																																	
"As appropriate, HMIF contains more hematite than MIF. %Other Fe in these two"																																	
"potential ore rock types averages between 3.1% and 7.4%, and possibly originates"																																	
mainly from minor silicates and carbonate.																																	
Phosphorus and sulfur is mostly low throughout all iron formation lithologies. Manganese																																	
"averages 0.4% to 0.5%. Typical of Labrador Trough taconites, Greenbush Zone"																																	
taconites are generally low in deleterious elements.

Davis Tube Tests Results:																																	
In addition to completing Head assays including determination of magnetite or magFe on																																	
"all samples, Cap-Ex completed exploration stage Davis Tube tests on selected samples"																																	
(these Davis Tube tests were separate and distinct from metallurgical stage testwork																																	
managed by BBA and described in Chapter 13 in this Report). WGM understands that																																	
the purpose of the Davis Tube tests was to provide a first approximation of concentrate																																	
chemistry and to provide support for the magFe determinations done by Satmagan.																																	
Davis Tube tests were done at both SGS-Lakefield and at AcmeLabs. The feed for the																																	
tests was the material prepared for the Head assays - this being 80% (SGS-Lakefield)																																	
"or 85% (AcmeLabs), passing -200 mesh (70?), (see Chapter 11). No optimization"																																	
testwork was done to determine grind parameters or stage grinding.																																	
"At SGS-Lakefield, Davis Tube tests were done on 312 samples. At AcmeLabs, tests"																																	
"were done on 480 samples. At both labs, the magnetic concentrates were analyzed by"																																	
XRF for major elements. Table 7-4 provides a summary of test results at SGS-Lakefield																																	
"and AcmeLabs, based on the average results for individual samples."

The reason for the poor performance of the Davis Tube tests is likely due to poorly																																	
constrained grinding; optimization testwork should have been conducted prior to tests on																																	
the Routine samples and stage grinding is required to determine this optimum grind.																																	
Specific Gravity and Density:																																	
Cap-Ex selected 162 samples from samples initially submitted to SGS-Lakefield in 2012																																	
for determination of specific gravity (“SG”). The determinations were completed on the																																	
sample pulps representing Routine sample intervals using the gas comparison method.																																	
The samples were selected to be representative of the deposit.																																	
Cap-Ex also requested SGS-Lakefield to determine SG on a set of 153 selected																																	
samples that had been originally prepared and assayed at AcmeLabs and sent to SGS-																																	
"Lakefield for Check assaying. The SG for the 315 samples is plotted on Figure 7-10,"																																	
against % TFe_H.																																	
"Cap-Ex has not yet requested any bulk density determinations, however, WGM did have"																																	
some determinations done as part of its Independent sampling and assaying

"8.	DEPOSIT TYPES"																																	
The iron formation on the Property is iron formation of the Lake Superior type. Lake																																	
Superior type iron formation consists of banded sedimentary rocks comprised principally																																	
"of bands of iron oxides, magnetite and hematite within quartz (chert)-rich rock with"																																	
"variable amounts of silicate, carbonate and sulphide lithofacies. Such iron formations"																																	
"have been the principal sources of iron throughout the world (Gross, 1996). Table 8-1"																																	
"(after Eckstrand, editor, 1984) presents the salient characteristics of the Lake Superior-"																																	
type iron deposit model.																																	
Lithofacies that are not highly metamorphosed or altered by weathering and are																																	
fine-grained are referred to as taconite. The Cap-Ex iron formation is taconite.																																	
Metamorphosed taconites are known as meta-taconite or itabirite (particularly if																																	
hematite-rich). The iron deposits in the Grenville part of the Labrador Trough in the																																	
"vicinity of Wabush and Labrador City, operated by IOCC (Carol), ArcelorMittal (Mont-"																																	
"Wright), Cliffs Natural Resources (""Cliffs"") (Wabush Mine and Bloom) and Alderon’s"																																	
(Kami) are meta-taconite.																																	
"For non-supergene-enriched iron formations to be economically mined, oxide iron"																																	
content must be sufficiently high but also the iron oxides must be amenable to																																	
concentration (beneficiation) and the concentrates produced must be low in deleterious																																	
"elements such as silica, aluminum, phosphorus, manganese, sulphur and alkalis. In"																																	
"meta-taconites, both the magnetite and hematite can often be concentrated to make a"																																	
"saleable product. In the taconites, the hematite is often too fine and is not easily"																																	
"concentrated, so little of it makes it into the saleable product."																																	
"For bulk mining, the silicate and carbonate lithofacies and other rock types interbedded"																																	
within the iron formation must be sufficiently segregated from the iron oxides. Folding																																	
and thrust faulting can be important for repeating iron formation and thickening iron																																	
formation beds to create economic concentrations of iron.

sources related to fracture systems and offshore volcanic activity. Deposition may be

"9.1	General"																																	
Historic exploration is summarized under the History section of the Report. WGM has																																	
"relied, for our descriptions of exploration program results, solely on the basis of reports,"																																	
notes and communications with Cap-Ex and various geophysical and other contractors.																																	
"Cap-Ex’s initial exploration program was in 2011, with a second program conducted in"																																	
"2012. In addition, Cap-Ex acquired orthophotographic mapping by Eagle Mapping from"																																	
an airborne survey completed in 2008.																																	
"9.2	Cap-Ex 2011 Exploration Program"																																	
Cap-Ex’s initial exploration program was in 2011. This program consisted mainly of																																	
"diamond drilling described under Section 10, Drilling, but also included a surface"																																	
mapping component and an airborne geophysical survey by Fugro Airborne Surveys Pty																																	
Ltd. (Fugro).																																	
Fugro Airborne Geophysical Survey:																																	
Fugro conducted a high-sensitivity aeromagnetic and FALCON™ Airborne Gravity																																	
Gradiometer (AGG) survey over the Block 103 Property and an adjacent property also																																	
owned by Cap-Ex (see Figures 7-5 and 7-6). The survey was completed between May																																	
"11, 2011 and May 20, 2011. To complete the survey, a total of 11 production flights were"																																	
"flown and a combined total of 3,441 line km of data acquired over both properties. The"																																	
survey line spacing was 200 m. The nominal ground clearance was 100 m monitored																																	
using a laser scanning system.																																	
"The dual frequency GPS base, backup dual frequency station and magnetometer base"																																	
stations were set up away from any cultural interference. The survey results were																																	
presented to Cap-Ex in two reports accompanied by digital data. The reports are titled:																																	
“Block 103 and Redmond Newfoundland and Labrador FALCON™ Airborne Gravity

"The products of the survey were a Digital Terrain Model (DTM), and various gravity"																																	
gradiometer and magnetic data presentations.																																	
The main purpose of the interpretation report was to define taconite and DSO																																	
exploration targets on the Property. Fugro’s interpreters applied a simple model:																																	
"?	DSO targets display an anomalous gravity high with a weak or absent magnetic"																																	
response;																																	
"?	Magnetite [taconite] targets display an anomalous response in both the gravity and"																																	
magnetic field data; and																																	
"?	Targets lie within or in the vicinity of iron formations."																																	
Twenty DSO and 35 magnetite taconite targets were defined on the Block 103 Property.																																	
"Subsequently, Intrepid Geophysics Ltd. (Intrepid), on behalf of Cap-Ex, reviewed the"																																	
Fugro data and applied additional filters to aid in the interpretation of the magnetic data.																																	
Additional products provided by Intrepid included edge filter enhancements to highlight																																	
edges surrounding both shallow and deeper magnetic sources. The results are used to																																	
infer the location of the boundaries of magnetized lithologies. The Block filter has the																																	
effect of transforming and segregating the data into apparent lithological categories or																																	
zones. Both filter groups change the textural character of a dataset and thereby facilitate																																	
interpretation of geological structures.																																	
Geological Mapping Program:																																	
The geological mapping program was carried out during the diamond drilling program.																																	
WGM understands the main purpose of the mapping was to provide the information																																	
"necessary to determine the set-up inclinations (dips) for the drillholes. Accordingly, strike"																																	
and dip information from outcrops in the drill area was collected. The drillhole planning																																	
then considered this information towards selecting the best azimuth and dip for the																																	
"drillholes and, subsequently, for interpreting drillhole and deposit geology."

Eagle Mapping Survey:																																	
The Eagle Mapping survey was conducted for SIOEC in 2008. Eagle Mapping																																	
subcontracted Airborne Sensing Corporation to fly the photo. With an agreement																																	
"between Cap-Ex and SIOEC, Eagle Mapping was authorized to produce 1:5,000 scale"																																	
mapping and orthophoto imagery at a resolution of 0.5 m from the photo. Positional																																	
"accuracy is said to be ±2.5 m or better, horizontally and vertically. Maps with 5 m"																																	
topographic contour intervals were generated. The mapping included planimetric																																	
"features, such as roads, buildings, streams and lakes. This work was completed in the"																																	
spring of 2012. The DTM from this survey was used for Cap-Ex’s Mineral Resource																																	
estimate.																																	
"9.3	Cap-Ex 2012 Exploration Program"																																	
"Cap-Ex’s program consisted almost entirely of diamond drilling, but a component of"

"10.3.2	2012 Drill Hole Collar and Down-Hole Attitude Surveying"																																	
"Prior to drilling the hole, collars were spotted with a hand-held GPS. The drilling"																																	
azimuths for inclined drillholes were established by lining up the drill on fore-sight and/or																																	
"back-sight pickets previously aligned along the desired azimuth, parallel with the"																																	
previously surveyed grid lines. Drill inclinations were established with a protractor fixed																																	
"on the drill head. In contrast to practice for the 2011 program, all the 2012 program"																																	
"casings were left in place. When a hole was completed, a post was placed at the collar"																																	
of the hole and this post was temporarily surveyed with a hand-held GPS.																																	
The survey firm Allnorth was contracted by Cap-Ex to survey the drillhole collars.																																	
"Allnorth visited the Property from October 5, 2012 to October 15, 2012. Allnorth was"																																	
"contracted to measure the surface position and elevation of the collar, and determine the"																																	
azimuth and deflection angle (drift) of each drill collar. A two (2) person field crew																																	
accessed the sites by motor-vehicle and helicopter. Allnorth’s results are reported in a																																	
"report titled: “Final Surveyor’s Report dated November 29, 2012."																																	
"Observations were taken at the center of each drillhole, recording the horizontal and"																																	
vertical position at the intersection of the collar and the existing ground. In order to																																	
"determine an azimuth and deflection angle of the drill collar, a jig was attached to either"																																	
"the casing, or inserted in the shaft. The jig created a projection of the drill collar and"																																	
"casing, providing a greater separation between observations. A second observation was"																																	
"taken with the instrument at the top centre of the jig, for position and elevation. From the"																																	
"measurements, collar location, dip and azimuth were calculated."																																	
"Of the 74 drillholes surveyed by Allnorth for either location and/or azimuth, only 10 were"																																	
"2011 program drillholes, and for many of these, only locations was surveyed, as casing"																																	
had been pulled in 2011. Fifty-eight of the 2012 drillholes were surveyed with selection																																	
based on importance to the Greenbush Zone. Cap-Ex’s plan for 2013 is to locate and

"imagery and DTM were processed in NAD27, while the drill collar observations by"																																	
Allnorth were recorded in NAD83 CSRS. This required a data conversion and the																																	
"conversion for the Schefferville region is not well defined. Regardless, the drill collar"																																	
coordinates were converted to NAD27 and overlaid on the DTM for a comparison of																																	
elevation. Through interpolation of the contour lines and random sampling of drill collar																																	
"elevation observations, discrepancies between 0.2 and 1.7 metres were found, with the"																																	
"discrepancy increasing with an increase in elevation. Drill collars further west, closest to"																																	
"the lake at the base of the slope, had the lowest discrepancy and it generally increased"																																	
moving east up the slope.																																	
Allnorth took further steps to try to investigate and better quantify the discrepancy but the																																	
required data was not available because the DTM from August 2008 was flown at high																																	
"altitude (1:30,000) and included an extremely large area."																																	
Down-hole tests were done on 23 of the 2012 drillholes with a North Seeking Gyroscope																																	
instrument by DGI as part of the borehole geophysics program. The 23 were selected																																	
due to of their availability and importance to the Greenbush Zone. A number of holes																																	
were not accessible because of blockage down-hole.																																	
The surveys were performed immediately after the termination of the drillhole while the																																	
drill rig was still set-up. The down-hole attitude surveys were performed with the rods																																	
"inside the borehole to prevent the borehole from collapsing, thus minimizing risk to the"																																	
equipment.																																	
The gyro data and the Allnorth collar survey data when available was used by Cap-Ex to																																	
accurately locate the drillholes in completing the Mineral Resource estimate. When																																	
"these survey products were not available, Cap-Ex’s database and Mineral Resource"

"10.3.3	Geophysical Down-Hole Surveying"																																	
DGI employed a multi-parameter digital logging system along with gyroscopic down-hole																																	
"drillhole attitude surveying included, natural gamma, poly electric, magnetic"																																	
"susceptibility, calliper, and optical televiewer (OTV) instrumentation to perform"																																	
geophysical surveys of the drillholes.																																	
The Poly Gamma probe measures variations in the presence of natural radioactivity.																																	
"Changes in natural radioactivity are typically related to concentrations of uranium,"																																	
thorium and potassium. Data acquired from this parameter is useful in identifying																																	
lithological changes.																																	
"The Gamma-Gamma Density probe measures rock density as a function of porosity,"																																	
fluid content and mineralogical composition; heavy elements increase the density																																	
"signature of the host rock. It is used to derive formation porosity, which is defined as the"																																	
ratio of pore volume to total volume of the rock; plus identification of open fractures																																	
towards achieving quantitative in-situ density.																																	
"The Poly-Electric probe measures: normal resistivity, spontaneous potential (SP), single-"																																	
"point resistivity (SPR), fluid resistivity, fluid temperature and natural gamma radiation."																																	
"Resistivity measurements can be used to identify lithology changes, often resulting from"																																	
changes in porosity. Fluid resistivity measurements are often used to correct the																																	
"resistivity measurements of the rock from the influence of drilling mud and borehole fluid,"																																	
and can also be indicative of borehole fractures. Temperature contrast data can identify																																	
zones of water movement through borehole fractures and faults relative to static water in																																	
the borehole column.																																	
The Magnetic Susceptibility probe delineates lithology by analyzing changes in the																																	
presence of magnetic minerals. Magnetic susceptibility data can illustrate lithological																																	
"changes and degree of homogeneity, and can be indicative of alteration zones. The"																																	
magnetic susceptibility probe is stabilized in the borehole fluid prior to calibration checks																																	
and the start of the survey runs. Calibration checks are performed before the																																	
deployment run and after the retrieval run using two points of known magnetic

susceptibility. Susceptibility data was used in conjunction with assay data to develop an																																	
equation converting magnetic susceptibility (CGS units) to a % magnetite content value																																	
estimate.																																	
The Optical Televiewer provides a detailed visualization of the borehole by capturing a																																	
high-resolution image of the borehole wall with precise depth control. The OTV captures																																	
a high-resolution 360° image perpendicular to the plane of the probe and borehole. This																																	
allows borehole bedding and fractures to be inspected by a direct camera angle. This																																	
"360° high-resolution image can be used to identify, measure and orient bedding, folding,"																																	
faulting and lithological changes in the borehole. The use of a gyro provides the relative																																	
orientation data to correct the image and feature orientation. 2D and 3D projections of																																	
this data provide a variety of interpretive options for analysis.																																	
The OTV data is reported as True Azimuth and as True Dip. It should be noted that																																	
Azimuth True for the feature is the azimuth of the dip direction rather than the strike of																																	
the feature. The strike azimuth for a feature is 90° from the value reported in the True																																	
Azimuth data column.																																	
"As aforementioned, 23 boreholes were surveyed during this project with various probes."																																	
It is WGM’s understanding that the OTV images for several geological contacts were																																	
reviewed during geological modelling of the Greenbush Zone towards completing the																																	
"geological interpretation, but the bulk of the data has not yet been reviewed in detail."																																	
"10.4	WGM Comment on 2011 and 2012 Drilling Programs"																																	
The 2011 drilling program focussed on testing individual geophysical anomalies defined																																	
by the MPX Geophysics airborne survey. The holes were scattered over the north part of																																	
the Property and there were few multi-hole cross sections. WGM observed that many of																																	
the drillholes were stopped in mineralization with apparent little regard for results. The																																	
"casings were also mostly pulled, making it impossible to re-enter interesting holes if"																																	
required. There was only one multi-hole cross section where the holes on the cross																																	
"section were reasonably close to each other, but it appeared that there was minimal"																																	
targeting of these holes towards defining structure.

"Regardless of these shortcomings, the program was sufficiently effective in showing the"																																	
"Property had potential, which appeared to be the main purpose of the 2011 program."																																	
The 2012 drilling program had a more structured approach with all holes located on																																	
cross sections and drilled sufficiently close together to try to provide the necessary																																	
information towards better understanding the structure of the Greenbush Zone. All collar																																	
locations have not yet been formally surveyed but Cap-Ex’s plans for 2013 include trying																																	
to find the remaining collars and to complete surveying of their locations.																																	
The re-logging component of the 2012 program was required in order to try to improve																																	
standardization of the lithological nomenclature towards better geological and deposit																																	
interpretation. Seventeen of the 2011 holes outside of the Mineral Resource area remain																																	
to be re-logged and this is planned for this spring.

"WGM has relied solely on the basis of reports, notes and communications with Cap-Ex,"																																	
"for descriptions of sample preparation and analyses, as well as WGM observations."																																	
WGM is also relying on reports produced by the analytical laboratories themselves.																																	
"11.1	Field Sampling and Preparation"																																	
The sampling description and discussions herein are for the drilling program conducted																																	
"by Cap-Ex in 2011 and 2012, and derive mostly from Cap-Ex sampling protocol"																																	
documents and direct observations by WGM during its site visit. Descriptions of Cap-																																	
"Ex’s 2011 core handling, logging and sampling process are sparse, and WGM’s"																																	
"account, reported here, was developed almost entirely based on observations of core"																																	
logs and archived drill core. The review of assaying and sampling/assay QA/QC was																																	
"completed by WGM, as a part of its validation process, using outtakes from the Project"																																	
"database, which was supplied by Cap-Ex."																																	
"11.1.1	2011 Drill Core Handling, Logging and Sampling"																																	
It is known that core from the field was transported to Schefferville for logging and																																	
sampling at a Cap-Ex operated facility. This facility was replaced in early 2012.																																	
"Original 2011 core logging was done by Ewa Radkiewicz-Walus, Alex Walus and Jacek"																																	
Szczepanski. Reasonable quality descriptive core logs were generated in MSExcel																																	
"spreadsheets, reporting drillhole azimuth and dip, rock code, rock description,"																																	
"foliation/banding angle with respect to core axis, estimate of magnetite by unit, as well"																																	
"as listing all core samples. However, the logs reviewed by WGM do not report drillhole"																																	
collar coordinates.																																	
"Based on the core logs, it is clear that sampling was done on a geological basis, with"																																	
mostly 3 m samples; samples were split coaxially using a mechanical core splitter.																																	
"Neither field Standards or Blanks were inserted into the sample stream, but core"																																	
Duplicates were collected (see Section 11.2.3). Samples were marked in the core trays																																	
"using aluminum tags. These labels, etched with the sample numbers, were stapled into"																																	
the core tray at the end of each sample interval.

"The early to mid-parts of the 2012 drilling program were also run by Alex Walus, Ewa"																																	
"Radkiewicz-Walus and Jacek Szczepanski. Consequently, the logging and sampling"																																	
protocols for these portions of the 2012 program were similar to the 2011 program. Later																																	
"in 2012, Edward Lyons replaced Alex Walus, Ewa Radkiewicz-Walus and Jacek"																																	
"Szczepanski, who left for other projects and the field practice was revised with the new"																																	
geologists.																																	
Early to Mid-2012 Program:																																	
"As aforementioned, field practice during this period was similar to the 2011 program."																																	
One aspect that differed was that field-inserted Blanks and Standards were added to																																	
supplement the field Duplicates. These Standards and Blanks were inserted at a																																	
"frequency of not less than one (1) per 20 Routine samples, with the Blanks and"																																	
"Standards often staggered, thus rather than Blanks and Standards being adjacent, they"																																	
were often ten (10) positions or less apart.																																	
Mid to Late 2012 Program:																																	
Core Handling:																																	
"Core was brought to the core facility in Schefferville, either by truck or by helicopter. The"																																	
"core boxes were transported with plywood lids screwed on, and upon receipt at the"																																	
"facility, they were organized in numerical order. Initially, the boxes were temporarily"																																	
"stacked on pallets. Subsequently, the trays were placed on steel core racks when these"																																	
were built later in the program.																																	
Geotechnical Logging:																																	
Geotechnical logging starts with the organization of core boxes on the logging benches.																																	
The geotechnicians checked the core for meterage blocks and continuity and orientation																																	
of core pieces. The geotechnical logging was done by measuring the core for recovery																																	
"and Rock Quality Designation (RQD), as well as fracture types and fillings, following the"

protocols established by geotechnical consultants on other similar projects. This logging																																	
"was done on a drill run, block to block basis, generally at nominal three (3) metre"																																	
intervals. Core recovery and rock quality data were measured for all drillholes. The																																	
information is entered into the acQuire™ database entry form on laptop computers.																																	
Descriptive Logging:																																	
"Core logging was conducted by several geologists, including Elsa Hernandez-Lyons,"																																	
"Keith Gillis and Allison Walsh, and was supervised by Edward Lyons, a member of the"																																	
"Association of Professional Engineers and Geoscientists of British Columbia, the"																																	
"professional Engineers and Geoscientists of Newfoundland and Labrador, and the Ordre"																																	
des Geologues du Quebec.																																	
"Once the core was logged for geotechnical data, the geologists marked the core for"																																	
"lithology, structure and mineralization. The data was entered on laptop computers using"																																	
acQuire™ entry panels developed by the ForbesWest geomatics staff and the site																																	
"geologists. Attention was directed to evaluating the percent content of iron oxides, as"																																	
"well as the major constituent gangue components of the Sokoman Formation facies,"																																	
"using a quaternary diagram developed by Mr. Lyons. Where possible, efforts were made"																																	
"to also assign Sokoman ""member” names to intervals, but the essential data remains the"																																	
"descriptive techniques. Drillhole locations, sample tables and geotechnical tables were"																																	
"all created separately in acQuire™ and are able to be merged with the geological tables,"																																	
if needed.																																	
Sampling and Security:																																	
The geologist selects the samples following the Sampling Protocol. Samples are																																	
"generally 3 m long or broken at changes in the lithology, including sharp changes in"																																	
proportions of iron oxide minerals. The sample tag is placed at the start of the samples																																	
and is stapled to the box. This position for the sample tag differs from what was done in																																	
2011 and in the early stages of the 2012 program. The sample number is written on the																																	
core as well.

"The results for the Field Duplicates are reasonable, indicating SGS-Lakefield assays are"																																	
precise. The Secondary Check assays at Inspectorate are unbiased and correlate																																	
"strongly with original SGS-Lakefield assays, indicating SGS-Lakefield assays for TFe"																																	
are also accurate.																																	
2012 In-Field QA/QC Assaying:																																	
"Cap-Ex’s 2012 program included field-inserted Blanks, Certified Reference Standards"																																	
"and core Duplicates, as well as more Secondary Check assaying."																																	
2012 Field Blanks (FBLK):																																	
"As part of the 2012 program, protocol Field Blanks were inserted into the sample stream"																																	
going to the analytical lab at a frequency of one (1) per 20 Routine samples. A total of 33																																	
of these Blanks accompanied samples going to SGS-Lakefield. The Blanks generally

have incorrect FeO values.																																	
2012 Field Duplicates (FDUP):																																	
"Similar to Field Blanks, Field Duplicates were inserted into the sample stream going to"																																	
"the labs at a frequency of one (1) per 20 Routine samples. During the 2012 program,"																																	
28 FDUPs were collected and analyzed at SGS-Lakefield for XRF-WR elements.

2012 Field Standards (FSTD):																																	
Four (4) different Certified Reference Standards were used for the 2012 program.																																	
"Two (2) of these Standards, MW-1 and SCH-1, were purchased from CANMET, Natural"																																	
"Resources, Canada. The remaining two (2) Standards, GB-1 and GB-2, were made by"																																	
"CDN Resources Ltd., Vancouver (CDN) from drill core provided by Cap-Ex from the"																																	
"2011 program. Following preparation at CDN, Smee & Associates Consulting Ltd."																																	
(Smee) provided certification for the two (2) Standards. This certification included the																																	
"assaying of the Standards, under Smee’s management, at six (6) accredited"																																	
"laboratories, each of which performing ten (10) analyses on randomly selected cuts from"																																	
"the materials. Each analysis included determination of TFe, Fe++ and magnetite by"																																	
"Satmagan. Subsequently, Smee completed statistical analysis of the analytical results,"																																	
defined a certified mean for each analyte and certified the two (2) materials.																																	
Table 11-5 provides a summary of Certified Values for each of the four (4) Standards.																																	
"The CANMET Standards are certified for major elements, with the exception of magFe."																																	
"MW-1 is certified for ferrous Fe, (Fe++), but SCH-1 is not. GB-1 and GB-2 are only"

"Where a Standard reports a value that is normal for another Standard, the probable"																																	
"cause is a mix-up in the field. In such cases, the issue has no impact on assay values for"																																	
"the Routine samples and the Mineral Resource estimate. However, the lab could also be"																																	
"at fault, and in such a case, the error is more serious. The follow-up of sampling"																																	
documents should enable Cap-Ex to eliminate many of these sampling errors.																																	
When the value for a Standard is altogether inappropriate and it cannot be traced to a																																	
"different Standard, a verification of the archived core is required. If this does not resolve"																																	
"the issue, the re-assay of the specific sample defining the issue and of at least some of"																																	
its adjacent samples is called for. WGM does not know why these issues were not

their impacts on the Mineral Resource estimate are negligible.																																	
2012 Secondary Check Assaying:																																	
Secondary Lab Check assaying was done during and following the 2012 drilling

assayed at AcmeLabs. Samples originally prepared and assayed at AcmeLabs were																																	
"sent to SGS-Lakefield for Check assay. The samples sent to SGS-Lakefield were pulps,"																																	
while those sent from SGS-Lakefield to AcmeLabs were all rejects. AcmeLabs had to																																	
consequently pulverize these samples. Check analysis for samples sent to either SGS-

MagFe determined by Satmagan versus Davis Tube and Fe Balance:																																	
WGM’s review of Sample/Assay QA/QC also included a review of the iron balance																																	
"between TFe, magFe and FeOTotal, completed on all samples, and a review of magFe"																																	
determined by Satmagan versus Davis Tube tests.																																	
"Because there are three (3) different and independent Fe determinations (TFe, magFe"																																	
"and FeOTotal) available for all samples, and certain relationships between permissible"																																	
"values are stoichiometrically defined, we can infer possible assay errors by inspection of"																																	
the relationships between the three (3) iron assays on a sample by sample basis.																																	
The permissible relationships between Fe species are developed based on equations																																	
2 and 3 (see Section 7.2.3 of this Report) and three (3) error types are defined.																																	
"1.	Where %Other Fe (from equation 3) is less than -2%, assay error is suspected."																																	
"2.	Where %hmFe (from equation 2) is less than -2%, error is also suspected."																																	
"3.	Where magFe exceeds TFe, error is suspected."																																	
"In WGM’s process of calculation of %OtherFe and %hmFe, small negative values"																																	
"greater than -2 are ignored, and these parameters are replaced with 0. Neither TFe nor"																																	
"magFe are revised; only %hmFe can be reduced, thus TFe from XRF is not exceeded"																																	
"by the sum of magFe, hmFe and OtherFe."																																	
"Cap-Ex, as part of their quality assurance process, has screened assays received and"

"11.3	WGM Comments and Conclusions Concerning Sampling, Assaying, QA/QC and"																																	
Project Database																																	
"In order to complete this Report, WGM has been provided with outtakes from Cap-Ex’s"																																	
acQuire™ Project database and has found the information to be comprehensive. No																																	
"actual 2012 drill logs were reviewed, but WGM’s understanding is that the logs appear to"																																	
"represent the database, reformatted into forms."																																	
WGM understands that Cap-Ex has employed a set of algorithms for classifying rock																																	
"types based on assays, and that Cap-Ex’s plan is to archive the actual codes"																																	
determined by their geologists during logging. WGM believes that the use of assays to																																	
estimate rock types is a useful technique to supplement drill core logging rock type																																	
"codes, but the logging codes should not be devalued. In WGM’s opinion, logging codes,"																																	
"although not perfect, are invaluable because they provide a guide to rock type,"

"independent of assays, while codes calculated from assays are dependent on the"																																	
"accuracy of sample location, on the algorithms used to determine the code and on assay"																																	
results that may harbour errors and issues.																																	
WGM believes Cap-Ex sampling and assay quality is more than adequate to support the																																	
Mineral Resource estimate at the Inferred level of categorization. Although some																																	
"probable sample and assay errors remain in the project database, and a few samples"																																	
appear to have been lost (a group of six (6) samples from drillhole 103-065 have no																																	
"assays), the database is remarkably clean, indicating generally reliable and accurate"																																	
assays. Some confusion still remains in the database regarding the nomenclature used																																	
"to identify different laboratory QA/QC materials, particularly Blanks and Duplicates."																																	
Distinguishing Preparation Blanks from Analytical Blanks and Preparation Duplicates																																	
from Analytical Duplicates in the database is not easily accomplished. WGM believes it																																	
"would be better to use generic names for these various materials, rather than what the"																																	
"particular lab calls them. For instance, at AcmeLabs, Preparation Blanks are called Core"																																	
"Reject Duplicates, and Analytical Duplicates are called ""REP”. At SGS-Lakefield,"																																	
Analytical Duplicates are called Duplicates and Preparation Duplicates are called																																	
Replicates. Maintaining this conflicting nomenclature in the database makes usage																																	
"difficult. Suggestions are PDUP, ADUP, PBLK and ABLK, respectively, for Preparation"																																	
and Analytical Duplicates and Blanks.																																	
"In WGM’s opinion, the Davis Tube tests on the assay samples should have been"																																	
completed on properly pulverized feed. Optimization tests are required to determine																																	
liberation size prior to routine tests. Proper optimized sample grinding would make the																																	
Davis Tube results more meaningful.																																	
WGM encourages Cap-Ex to pursue the suspected errors that remain in the database																																	
and continue to improve and simplify its database structure. WGM also believes that																																	
Cap-Ex should complete the documentation of its QA/QC procedures and policies.

"WGM Senior Associate Geologist, Richard Risto, P.Geo., visited the Property from"																																	
"November 14, to November 16, 2012 just as logging and sampling for the 2012 program"																																	
was finishing and the facilities were being closed up for the season. Cap-Ex’s Chief																																	
"Geologist, Mr. Edward Lyons, P.Geo. (BC), geo (QC), P.Geo. (NL) was host for the visit."																																	
Cap-Ex operates a core shed and sampling facility with a core storage area in the																																	
Schefferville industrial park. They also own and rent several houses to provide office																																	
facilities and accommodation for geotechnical personnel.																																	
The purpose for this visit was to initiate the project review process. Mr. Risto reviewed																																	
"drilling completed to date, deposit interpretation, logging and sampling procedures,"																																	
collected independent samples and visited the Property to validate drilling sites.																																	
Mr. Risto and Mr. Lyons accessed the Property by helicopter to check a number of																																	
abandoned drill sites on the Property. WGM observed that most were posted and																																	
"labelled, but a few were missing labels and some posts had fallen down. WGM validated"																																	
drillhole locations in the field using a hand-held GPS and checked casing inclinations																																	
and azimuths. Mr. Risto found that for most part his Eastings and Northings closely																																	
matched those in Cap-Ex’s database within a few metres and collar dips closely																																	
"matched database dips to within ±2o. WGM found one drillhole, 103-034, that did not"																																	
"match its database location. Between the Project database and Mr. Risto’s check, the"																																	
location of the drillhole differed by 200 m.																																	
WGM also validated logging and sampling procedures; checked logging and checked																																	
sample locations in core trays during the independent sampling process.																																	
Table 12-1 lists locations and selected analytical results for WGM’s eleven independent																																	
second-half core samples collected from 2011 and 2012 drill core in storage at																																	
Schefferville. There are no Cap-Ex FeO determinations for several of the samples.																																	
Appendix 1 contains SGS-Lakefield’s certificate of analysis for the samples.

Figure 12-5: %MnO_H for WGM Independent Sample vs. Cap-Ex Original Sample																																	
Assay results for WGM Independent samples and corresponding Cap-Ex samples are																																	
generally correlated but the degree of correlation for TFe and SiO2 is lower than																																	
"expected. The good correlation between data sets for MnO, FeOTotal and for magFe"																																	
(excepting one sample) indicates minimal probability of any sample mix-ups in the field																																	
or in the lab. The poor correlation for TFe is unexplained. WGM observed during its site																																	
visit that the condition of the 2011 drill core was not ideal with sample tags often missing.																																	
The tags in the trays also did not include sample interval information. The fact of missing																																	
"tags however, may not have been a product of original sampling, but 2012 re-logging."																																	
"Regardless, several of the samples showing poor TFe correlation are 2012 samples."																																	
WGM’s samples had SG determined by gas comparison pycnometer and also had bulk																																	
density determined by weighing the samples in air and in water. Figure 12-6 shows																																	
"WGM pycnometer SG, bulk density results, as well as the best fit line determined from"																																	
Cap-Ex’s pycnometer SG results (see Section 7.2.3 in this Report).

The testwork program undertaken in this PEA Study was aimed at establishing a																																	
"baseline characterization of the mineralogy, metallurgy and grindability of the Block 103"																																	
"deposit. No previous or historical testwork of any significance has been performed, either"

"?	Head sample Satmagan (SAT) and whole rock analysis (WRA);"																																	
"?	Head sample size-by-size analysis;"																																	
"?	Head sample size-by-size Mineral Liberation Analysis (MLA);"																																	
"?	Low Intensity Magnetic Separation (LIMS) and size-by-size Davis Tube (DT)"																																	
analysis of magnetic and non-magnetic fractions to determine Mag Fe liberation																																	
versus SiO2 content at various particle sizes;																																	
"?	Heavy Liquid Separation (HLS) on LIMS tailings to determine the presence of"																																	
recoverable hematite;																																	
"?	Wet and dry LIMS at coarse particle sizes to determine coarse cobbing performance"																																	
in order to reject gangue (with minimal Fe losses);																																	
"?	Grindability tests."																																	
"In this PEA, results of the baseline testwork program were used for the following:"																																	
"?	To develop a conceptual flowsheet for ore processing;"																																	
"?	Estimate plant throughput;"																																	
"?	Estimate Fe and weight recoveries;"

"13.1	Geology and Sampling"																																	
"At the early stages of the PEA, a sample selection and sample compositing strategy was"																																	
"developed in collaboration with the Cap-Ex geology team, based on the limited"																																	
understanding of the deposit at that time. The deposit was classified into five main																																	
"sectors, as follows:"																																	
"?	North Upper Horizon (NUH)"																																	
"?	East Upper Horizon (EUH)"																																	
"?	East Lower Horizon (ELH)"																																	
"?	West Upper Horizon (WUH)"																																	
"?	West Lower Horizon (WLH)"																																	
"The deposit was therefore divided into a North, East and West region and the East and"																																	
West regions each had an upper and lower horizon. Drill holes in the North region did																																	
not extend to sufficient depth to allow for a North Lower Horizon to be defined.																																	
Figure 13-1 shows the exploration drilling pattern and drill cores selected for samples																																	
"and sample compositing. As can be seen, samples are well dispersed and are deemed"																																	
to be reasonably representative of the five sectors targeted by the testwork.																																	
Holes sampled for the testwork program are circled in green (core reject samples for																																	
compositing) or violet (full or half core samples for grindability tests and coarse cobbing

"13.3.2	LIMS Testwork Results from Composite Samples"																																	
"Each of the sector composite samples was subjected to a wet, single stage LIMS test, as"																																	
indicated in the test plan shown previously in Figure 13-2. In examining the weight																																	
"recoveries as well as SAT and silica assay results, it was noted that results showed poor"																																	
"separation, especially in the finer sizes. Silica entrainment was suspected and confirmed"																																	
by performing DT tests on the finest fractions of some of the composite samples. A clean																																	
product was obtained following DT testing and results were generally in line with the DT																																	
results directly on the composite head samples.																																	
"13.3.3	HLS Testwork Results"																																	
HLS testing was done on the NUH LIMS tailings as per the test plan. This analysis was																																	
done to explore the possibility of recovering non-magnetic iron believed to be mainly in																																	
the form of hematite. Results of the analysis did not indicate the possibility of a gravity																																	
"separation step for the production of a hematite concentrate, since only a small fraction"																																	
"(less than 5% of the weight) reported to the sink fraction. Following these results, it was"																																	
decided not to proceed further with the HLS testwork on the other samples for this PEA.																																	
"13.3.4	MLA Testwork Results"																																	
Mineral liberation analysis (MLA) and optical microscopy was completed on head																																	
"samples of composites from each of the five sectors. For each composite, the following"																																	
"sections were mounted, polished and analyzed for mineralogy:"																																	
"?	+ 425 ?m"																																	
"?	- 425 ?m/ +150 ?m"																																	
"?	- 150 ?m/ +75 ?m"																																	
"?	- 75 ?m"																																	
"MLA results show iron oxide mostly present as magnetite, but also indicate an important"																																	
presence of hematite (mostly in the western sectors). Iron is also present as carbonates																																	
"in Ankerite (Ca(Fe,Mg,Mn)(CO3)2) and Siderite (Fe(CO3)), and to a lesser extent, present"																																	
"as Minnesotaite ((Fe,Mg)3Si4Oi0(OH)2) and other silicates. Mineralogical modal"																																	
compositions are detailed for each sector in Table 13-5 and the iron distribution within																																	
minerals is shown in Table 13-6.

"13.3.5	Wet and Dry Cobbing Test Results"																																	
This testwork was performed by SGS-Lakefield Minerals Services. According to the test																																	
"plan previously presented, a composite sample was produced from remaining SMC"																																	
"test® samples, combining samples from NUH, EUH and ELH."																																	
Table 13-7 presents the analysis of the three individual samples and the composite used																																	
for the test.																																	
Single-stage dry magnetic separation (dry cobbing) tests were performed on two splits																																	
"from the composite sample, prepared to a P100 of 7,000 and 3,000 ?m. The purpose of"																																	
"this test was to evaluate the possibility of incorporating a dry, coarse cobbing step, within"																																	
"a HPGR-based primary grinding circuit, that would reject coarse gangue minerals and"																																	
would thus reduce the amount of material carried into the concentrator’s regrind and																																	
magnetic circuit. Results from these tests are presented in Table 13-8. As can be seen																																	
"from the results, non-magnetic weight rejection is very similar for the two particle sizes"																																	
"(26% to 27%) with minimal magnetite losses at less than 3%. It should be noted that,"																																	
"from a practical point of view, lab scale dry cobbing results can vary significantly from"																																	
results of industrial scale operations due to challenges associated with processing humid																																	
material.

This testwork was performed by SGS-Lakefield Minerals Services. Three size categories

"particles larger or smaller than this, used in SMC testing, will require calibrations that are"																																	
in proportion with the size difference. Most samples available for this study were half

diameter of 47.6 mm) and NTW (core diameter of 56 mm) full cores were sampled where

"During the course of this PEA Study, following the publication of the Block 103 Mineral"																																	
"Resource Estimate (M. Kociumbas and R.W. Risto 2012), Cap-Ex management decided,"																																	
"for a number of reasons, to focus this PEA on one portion of the overall deposit,"																																	
"consisting of a 30-year, approximately 2Bt starter pit located predominantly in the"																																	
"eastern (and also in portions of the northern) sectors of the deposit. Where possible,"																																	
metallurgical and process design parameters were based on testwork results from																																	
samples in these regions.																																	
"Based on the analysis and interpretation of the testwork results, two process flowsheets"																																	
were developed: one based on SAG primary grinding and one based on HPGR primary																																	
"grinding. These are shown in Figure 13-4 and Figure 13-5, respectively. In order to"																																	
"simplify the comparison, it was assumed that both grinding circuits produced the same"																																	
feed to the wet cobber LIMS and to the magnetic and regrind circuit. Following primary																																	
"crushing, a primary grinding transfer size of P100 = 2,000 ?m was selected based on wet"																																	
cobber LIMS testwork results.																																	
"With the results of magnetic separation tests, it was determined that a single-drum wet"																																	
cobbing step will reject 32.6 wt % of the ore as coarse tailings. The cobber concentrate																																	
"will then feed a conventional magnetic and regrind circuit including Ball Mill regrinding,"																																	
LIMS magnetic separation and hydrocyclones and screens for size classification. The																																	
"final concentrate will exit the circuit after a screening at 75 ?m, with a final P80 of 41 ?m."

"14.1	Mineral Resource Estimate Statement"																																	
"Following the completion of additional drilling during 2012, Cap-Ex prepared an initial"																																	
Mineral Resource estimate for the Block 103 Property. WGM was retained by Cap-Ex to																																	
audit this in-house estimate. Information used for this estimate was based on all drillhole																																	
data that was completed by the end of 2012 and included a minor amount of drilling from																																	
the previous year. The current Mineral Resource estimate was completed only on part of																																	
"the Property, known as the Greenbush Zone, where the drilling density and confidence"																																	
was sufficient to define the resource. Most of the drilling from 2011 was therefore not																																	
included because it fell outside of this more densely drilled Greenbush Zone area.																																	
"The current Mineral Resource is categorized as Inferred, based on drillhole spacing,"																																	
data quality (and confidence) and search ellipse distances. Resources are interpolated																																	
"out to a maximum of about 600 m along strike, and 400 m on the ends/edges and at"																																	
"depth, when supporting information from adjacent cross-sections was available. The"																																	
Mineral Resources are reported above 100 m elevation level (about 500 m from																																	
surface).

The Gemcom™ drillhole database consisted of 115 diamond drillholes; including holes																																	
"that were re-drilled in whole or in part, due to lost core/bad recovery. The Mineral"																																	
Resource estimate for the Greenbush Zone is based on results from 81 diamond																																	
"drillholes, totalling 23,735 m. These holes were fairly regularly dispersed in the iron"																																	
"mineralization, along approximately 4,000 m of strike length and a range of 2,000 to"																																	
"2,500 m of width for the central portion of the Property. The remaining drillholes (drilled"																																	
mostly in 2011) in the database were located outside of the geological interpretation																																	
currently being used for the Mineral Resource estimate. These holes are located to the																																	
NW and SE of the more densely drilled area and often do not penetrate the entire iron																																	
formation horizon(s). They are therefore excluded from the current Mineral Resource																																	
"estimate, which is limited to a portion of the Greenbush Zone, as presently defined (see"																																	
previous Figures 7-3 to 7-7). The current drillhole density is insufficient to completely																																	
"understand the complex structure (folded and multiple thrust faults), geology and"																																	
mineralization and therefore all Mineral Resources are currently categorized as Inferred																																	
"until more infill drilling, particularly between cross-sections, can be completed."																																	
The drillholes contained geological codes and short descriptions for each unit and sub-																																	
"unit, as well as assay data for Head analyses. The raw sample intervals totalled 5,563"																																	
within the mineralized zones (including internal waste) and ranged from 0.50 m to

"14.5.1	Cross-Section Definition"																																	
Sixteen vertical cross-sections were defined for the Greenbush Zone for the purpose of																																	
Mineral Resource estimation. The current Inferred Resource is based primarily on 2012																																	
"drilling, which was conducted on eight (8) cross-sections (see Figure 7-4, Chapter 7),"																																	
focused on part of the Block 103 Property. The main objective of the 2012 drilling																																	
campaign was to identify potential mineralized horizons for the purpose of modelling and																																	
Mineral Resource estimation and to ensure that the drillholes penetrated the entire																																	
"stratigraphic package, which may be repeated multiple times due to low-angle thrust"																																	
faulting. Holes from the 2011 drilling program (mainly to the SE and NW of the																																	
"Greenbush area) were excluded as they did not intersect the entire mineralized zone, or"																																	
get through the repetitive packages. These drillholes were often aborted in the upper																																	
"mineralized horizons, prior to reaching the non-mineralized basal sedimentary unit."																																	
"However, some of the 2011 drilling was used for the Mineral Resource estimate, in"																																	
cases where the holes were drilled in the vicinity of the 2012 drilling area.																																	
"The drillhole spacing, i.e., cross-section spacing, along the strike of the mineralized"																																	
"zones, is approximately 600 m. The section lines were planned to be perpendicular to"																																	
the strike of the mineralized zones (oriented at 320°N). The drillhole spacing on the																																	
"cross-sections varied from 60 m to about 250 m, and vertical depths ranged from 50 m"																																	
to 400 m. Some cross-sections have geological interpretations down to the 100 m level																																	
"(about 500 m below surface), however, no Mineral Resources are defined below the"																																	
100 m level. The mineralized zones in the south parts of the Greenbush Zone were																																	
drilled with tighter spacing within the cross-sections (denser drilling pattern across the																																	
mineralized zones) to allow for a better definition of the geological and structural																																	
"interpretations; however, the NW part of the Greenbush Zone (north of Cross-"																																	
"Section 10960N) has wider spaced drilling along the sections (up to 600 m spacing),"																																	
based on the previous exploration program.																																	
"Because of the variable drilling pattern, most cross-sections contained at least three (3)"																																	
"holes, and many had more than 10 holes passing through the mineralized zones. See"

Block 103 contains Lake Superior-type iron formation consisting of banded sedimentary																																	
"rocks, composed principally of bands of iron oxides, magnetite and hematite within"																																	
quartz (chert)-rich rock. The interpretation for the mineralized units was first hand-drawn																																	
on paper cross-sections by Cap-Ex geologists on site during the drilling program. These																																	
units are fairly recognizable by logging based on lithological/mineralogical characteristics																																	
and color. The interpretation was also based on comparison with regional and geological																																	
units in the Labrador Trough. A lithological member’s nomenclature was adopted from																																	
"IOCC’s previous work in the area and from geology of similar properties, such as New"																																	
Millennium Iron Corp’s KeMag and LabMag deposits. WGM reviewed Cap-Ex’s																																	
geological interpretations from the cross-sections that defined the boundaries of the																																	
"mineralized zone for the Mineral Resource estimate, after the zone boundaries were"																																	
imported into GemcomTM. Each polyline was assigned an appropriate rock type and																																	
"stored with its section definition. The digitized lines were ""snapped” to drillhole intervals"																																	
to anchor the line which allows for the creation of a true 3-D wireframe that honours the																																	
3-D position of the drillhole interval.																																	
Wireframes were created using the digitized footwall and hanging wall contacts for the																																	
mineralized zones and waste zones and the controlling set of thrust faults (see																																	
Figure 14-4). The wireframes for each mineralized zone were closed at the bedrock																																	
"surface, at fault boundaries and at the maximum depth and strike boundaries. The"																																	
Greenbush Zone is strongly influenced by a set of major listric faults. Some folding and																																	
multiple thrusting events have juxtaposed older units over younger units (or one entire																																	
"sedimentary package on top of another) along these fault zones. Therefore, the"																																	
thickness of iron formation has been dramatically increased over a much shorter strike																																	
"length, in comparison to the more advanced, simpler and better understood taconite"																																	
deposits of New Millennium and Adriana Resources Inc. These thrust faults were chosen																																	
as hard boundaries between mineralized zones and non-mineralized sedimentary rocks																																	
and were modeled separately and tied to drillhole intervals. These faults were identified

through visual observation of the healed contacts in core logging and the position of																																	
"each member, in context of the overall regional stratigraphy. The lithological"																																	
characteristics of the Sokoman Formation and the other sedimentary units are described																																	
in Chapter 7 of this Report.																																	
Due to the early exploration stage of the deposit and the lack of drilling leading to some																																	
"uncertainty regarding the complex structural geology, it was decided not to define each"																																	
"sub-member separately for the current Mineral Resource estimate. Furthermore, the"																																	
folding adds another complication to the structural geology. Any discrepancies or																																	
differences between Cap-Ex’s and WGM’s interpretations were discussed with Cap-Ex’s																																	
technical personnel and it was determined that the differences in interpretation were not																																	
materially significant at this stage of drilling and definition of the deposit. It was therefore																																	
"agreed that Cap-Ex’s interpretation would be used. However, once more drilling is"																																	
"completed during the next phase of exploration, the modelling may be further refined,"																																	
based on a better understanding of the structural geology and the importance of																																	
differentiating the sub-members.																																	
"Based on the existing drilling, the continuity of the mineralization, as a whole, appeared"																																	
to be quite good; there is enough confidence to extend the interpretation to up to 600 m																																	
"in distance along strike, and to about 400 m at depth, based on previous experience with"																																	
this type of mineralization. The wireframes extended as long as there was drillhole																																	
information and supporting data from adjacent cross-sections. Even though the																																	
wireframes continued to a maximum depth of 100 m (approximately 500 m vertically																																	
"below surface and extending 100 m past the deepest drilling), at this time, no Mineral"																																	
Resources were defined/considered below 100 m elevation. This hard boundary was																																	
marked by a major thrust and by its listric branches in the west part of the Property. The																																	
upper elevations of the models were limited to the bedrock-overburden contact.																																	
As a further refinement to the boundaries defining the potentially economic																																	
"mineralization, a modeling cutoff grade for the horizons was set at 10% magFe, which"																																	
appears to be almost a natural cutoff grade for the magnetite Fe mineralization. The																																	
"boundaries were adjusted based on this 10% threshold, and these outlines were"																																	
"digitized on each cross-section as closed polygons in Leapfrog™ 3-D mining software,"

"14.5.3	Topographic Surface Creation"																																	
A wireframed surface or triangulated irregular network (TIN) was generated by Cap-Ex																																	
for the topography surface and overburden contacts. The wireframed topography																																	
surface was derived from a gridded digital elevation model which was supplied by Eagle																																	
Mapping Services as a product of an aerial photo survey. The topography wireframe was																																	
offset to drillhole overburden/bedrock contacts using Leapfrog™ software to create the																																	
overburden wireframe and to ensure the overburden did not cross the topography																																	
surface where no drillhole information existed.																																	
WGM checked the overburden surface created by Cap-Ex against the drillhole																																	
information and found it to be properly created. These surfaces were used to limit the																																	
"upper boundary of the geological block model, i.e., the Mineral Resources were defined"

"14.6.3	Grade Capping"																																	
The statistical distribution of the %TFe and %magFe samples showed normal																																	
"distributions. Grade capping, sometimes referred to as top cutting, is commonly used in"																																	
the Mineral Resource estimation process to limit the effect (risk) associated with																																	
"extremely high assay values, but considering the nature of the mineralization and the"																																	
"continuity of the zones, Cap-Ex determined that capping was not required for Block 103"																																	
and WGM agrees with this assessment.																																	
"14.6.4	Density/Specific Gravity"																																	
Specific gravity is previously discussed in detail in Section 7.2.3 of this Report. Most of																																	
"the iron formation consists of a mix of magnetite and hematite, however, there are areas"																																	
"which contain very little hematite and are mostly magnetite, and vice versa."																																	
"Previously, for some of these types of deposits, WGM used one (1) average density"																																	
"value for each sub-member for the Mineral Resource estimate. However, since there are"																																	
so many repeating sub-units and there is not enough information to assess the SG on a																																	
"per unit basis, WGM assessed the relationship of SG to %TFe on available samples."																																	
Cap-Ex completed SG determinations on selected pulps from 315 routine samples at																																	
"SGS-Lakefield, using the gas comparison pycnometer method. For the 2012 drilling"																																	
"program, Cap-Ex also used a DGI probe for selected holes and recorded major physical"																																	
"properties, including density. However, due to the size of the drill core barrels, Cap-Ex’s"																																	
"contractor (DGI) could not use the full scale probe for the 2012 holes and therefore,"																																	
"instead of actual density, a relative density was recorded by the probe. This relative"																																	
density required conversion to actual density. Due to the uncertainty in the method of																																	
"conversion used by DGI for the current Mineral Resource estimate, a best-fit line,"																																	
"generated from the available laboratory-measured SG data and %TFe, was chosen to"																																	
"convert volumes to tonnes (see Figure 7-10, shown previously)."																																	
"A best fit correlation line (%TFe x 0.0279 + 2.5695), based on the pycnometer data used"																																	
"to obtain the density of each block in the model, was used for the current Mineral"																																	
Resource estimate to create a variable density model to estimate tonnage. WGM																																	
determined that a variable density model would more accurately define the local

"variations based on grade, compared to the ""per sub-unit basis” used for some previous"																																	
Mineral Resource estimates. This formula reflects WGM’s experience with other iron ore																																	
deposits that we have modeled and we have found that SG shows excellent correlation																																	
"with %TFe, as is typical with these types of deposits. Our experience also shows that"																																	
both methods returned very similar overall results when sufficient information is																																	
"available. Using the variable density model, a 30% TFe gives a SG of approximately"

"14.7	Block Model Parameters, Grade Interpolation & Categorization of Mineral"																																	
Resources																																	
"14.7.1	General"																																	
The Block 103 Mineral Resource estimates were completed using a block modelling																																	
method and the grades were interpolated using an Inverse Distance (ID) estimation																																	
"technique. ID belongs to a distance-weighted interpolation class of methods, similar to"																																	
"Kriging, where the grade of a block is interpolated from several composites within a"																																	
defined distance range of that block. ID uses the inverse of the distance (to the selected																																	
"power) between a composite and the block, as the weighting factor."																																	
"Cap-Ex used an ID2 interpolation method, and for comparison and cross-checking"																																	
"purposes, WGM used ID and ID10 methods, which closely resemble a Nearest"																																	
"Neighbour (NN) technique. In the NN method, the grade of a block is estimated by"																																	
"assigning only the grade of the nearest composite to the block. In WGM’s experience, all"																																	
"interpolation methods usually give similar results, as long as the grades are well"																																	
constrained within the wireframes. The results of the interpolation approximated the																																	
average grade of all of the composites used for the estimate. WGM’s experience with																																	
"similar types of deposits showed that geostatistical methods, like Kriging, give very"																																	
"similar results when compared to ID interpolation, therefore we are of the opinion that ID"																																	
"interpolation is appropriate and accepted Cap-Ex’s grade interpolation, as supplied."																																	
"14.7.2	Block Model Setup / Parameters"																																	
The Block 103 block model was created using the Gemcom™ software package to																																	
create a grid of regular blocks to estimate tonnes and grades. The parameters used for																																	
the block modelling are summarized below:

The block sizes used were:																																	
Width of columns = 30 m																																	
Width of rows = 100 m																																	
Height of blocks = 10 m																																	
The specific parameters for the block model are as follows:																																	
"Easting coordinate of model bottom left hand corner:	611950.00"																																	
"Northing coordinate of model bottom left hand corner:	6089600.00"																																	
"Datum elevation of top of model:	700.00 m"

"Number of columns in model:	155"																																	
"Number of rows in model:	60"																																	
"Number of levels:	65"																																	
The block model coverage is shown in Figure 14-4 and was large enough to encompass																																	
"the Mineral Resource area, down to the 50 m level. The major geological components"																																	
that were modelled in 3-D for Mineral Resource estimation are also shown in the figure.

"14.7.3	Grade Interpolation"																																	
The structural geology and geometry of the sub-members and repeating stratigraphic																																	
"packages are not completely understood, due to the current lack of drilling. Experimental"																																	
variograms were prepared for all of the mineralized horizons using the composited assay																																	
dataset for magFe and TFe. The composited data was lumped together in order to																																	
achieve the maximum continuity for the entire mineralized package of the Greenbush																																	
"Zone. This was considered to be appropriate at this stage of the project, as the Mineral"																																	
Resources are all currently categorized as Inferred. Variograms were constructed by																																	
applying the average strike (320N°) of the deposit and the general dip of the mineralized																																	
units (-30°NE).																																	
"Based on these variograms, three (3) directions of continuity (major, intermediate and"																																	
minimum) were determined for the mineralized horizons. The maximum continuity was																																	
"set to the range of variograms for each direction, in order to inform the blocks with"																																	
grade. Table 14-3 shows the three (3) directions of continuity and their affiliated range of																																	
variograms.

"Based on the range of the variograms, a search ellipsoid was designed, incorporating an"																																	
axis of anisotropy and the applied parameters to interpolate grade within the blocks. A																																	
Distance Model was also generated to validate the search criteria and to limit the																																	
extension of the grade interpolation into the blocks in the model. For the purposes of																																	
"grade interpolation, some constraints were applied. The minimum and maximum number"																																	
"of sample composites used to estimate the grade of a block was set to 2 and 9, based"																																	
on the drilling density and required degree of confidence. If there weren’t at least two (2)																																	
"samples within the defined search volume, then a default value of 0.00 was assigned to"																																	
that block. If more than the maximum number of samples was found within the defined

number of samples to be selected per hole was set to two (2). If more than two (2)																																	
"samples from one (1) drillhole are found within the search ellipse, the interpolation"																																	
"routine searches for further points (samples), even though the next closest sample may"																																	
still be from the same drillhole.																																	
GemcomTM does not use the sub-blocking method for determining the proportion and																																	
"spatial location of a block that falls partially within a wireframed object. Instead, the"																																	
system makes use of a Percent or Partial block model (if it is important to track the																																	
different rock type proportions in the block - usually if there is more than one (1)																																	
"important type), or uses a ""needling technology"" that is similar in concept, but offers"																																	
greater flexibility and granularity for accurate volumetric calculations. For the purpose of																																	
"this Mineral Resource estimate, Cap-Ex/WGM decided not to use the Percent model,"																																	
"due to the level of confidence in the resource at this stage. A 50-50 model was used,"																																	
therefore blocks in the model were flagged as either 100% mineralized (and were used																																	
for grade interpolation) or 100% waste. It was also decided to use larger blocks (100 m x																																	
30 m x 10 m high) due to the wide drillhole spacing and to the entire resource being																																	
classified in the Inferred category (see below).																																	
"14.7.4	Mineral Resource Categorization"																																	
Mineral Resource classification is based on certainty and continuity of geology and																																	
"grades, and this is almost always directly related to the drilling density. Areas more"																																	
"densely drilled are usually better known and understood than areas with sparser drilling,"																																	
"which would be considered to have greater uncertainty, and hence, lower confidence."																																	
"WGM has abundant experience with similar types of mineralization to Block 103, and we"																																	
used this knowledge to assist us in the interpretation and categorization of the Mineral																																	
"Resources. In a general sense, the continuity of the mineralization was quite good;"																																	
"however, the internal continuity of some sub-members and some waste units is poorly"																																	
understood because of the folding/geometric complexity and thrusting. WGM was of the																																	
opinion that extending the geological interpretation beyond the more densely drilled																																	
"parts of the deposit was appropriate at this lower level of confidence, as long as there"																																	
was supporting data from adjacent sections. All of the Mineral Resources for the

"Block 103 Property were classified as Inferred, and grades were interpolated to a"																																	
maximum of approximately 600 m on the ends/edges and at depth. The average																																	
distance (from the Distance Model) for the Inferred Mineral Resources was																																	
approximately 165 m. The maximum depth that the mineralization was taken to was																																	
"100 m elevation (approximately 500 m vertically, from surface)."																																	
Additional drilling is required to get a better understanding of the complex structural																																	
"geology, particularly in the area where folding and thrusting occur together, as it can"																																	
lead to ambiguous interpretations. There were some minor discrepancies or differences																																	
"between Cap-Ex’s and WGM’s geological interpretations, and these were discussed with"																																	
Cap-Ex technical personnel. It was determined that the differences in interpretation were																																	
not materially significant at this stage of drilling and definition of the deposit. It was																																	
"therefore agreed that Cap-Ex’s interpretation would be used. However, once additional"																																	
"drilling is completed during the next phase of exploration, the modelling will be further"																																	
"refined, based on a better understanding of the structural geology and the importance of"																																	
"differentiating the sub-members, to potentially better control grade distribution by"																																	
"invoking more ""hard boundaries”."																																	
"14.7.5	Mineral Resource Reporting"																																	
"The Mineral Resource for Block 103, as determined by the methodology described"																																	
"above, is reported at a 12.5% magFe cutoff grade. The 12.5% cut-off grade was chosen"																																	
on the basis of a preliminary review of the parameters that would likely determine the																																	
"economic viability of a large open pit operation, and in comparison with other deposits in"																																	
"Labrador Trough, taking into consideration the unknown weight recovery at this stage of"																																	
the project. This cut-off was chosen and compares well to similar projects and to projects																																	
that are currently at a more advanced stage of study. Once more drilling is carried out																																	
"and additional DT testwork is completed, and once the results of the current"

The comparisons above show the global average of the interpolated grades of all of the																																	
blocks in the wire-framed (modelled) domains to be almost identical to the average of all																																	
assays and composites used for grade estimation. Some local differences may be																																	
"evident, but at this early stage of exploration, and considering the definition of Inferred"																																	
"Mineral Resources, any variances observed were not considered to be material."																																	
"14.7.7	Interpretations and Conclusions"																																	
"In comparison with most other taconite deposits in the Labrador Trough, the Property"																																	
contains a significant Mineral Resource tonnage along a much shorter strike length. The																																	
main reason for this tonnage increase is due to low angle thrust faulting in the																																	
"Greenbush Zone area, causing the stratigraphic units and mineralized packages to be"																																	
repeated multiple times in the same volume. The multiple thrusting appears to have also																																	
"decreased the amount of waste, as mineralized horizons are laid on top of each other."																																	
Folding and thrust faulting of the sedimentary packages in the Property area is not a new																																	
"discovery or interpretation, but the current tighter space drilling, along the"																																	
"aforementioned part of Block 103 on certain cross-sections, provides a good framework"																																	
to refine the interpretation of the lithological units and identify sub-members of Sokoman																																	
Formation that are not normally in contact with each other. Mineralized and																																	
non-mineralized domains were modelled and separated into the hanging wall and																																	
footwall of these fault zones. The thrusting sometimes eliminated the waste units of Ruth																																	
"or Wishart Formation, and therefore mineralized horizons occur both on the hanging wall"																																	
and footwall sides of these thrust fault zones. This was an extremely important factor																																	
that substantially increased the thickness (and hence tonnage) of mineralized Sokomon																																	
Formation in the central part of Block 103 through stacking of the stratigraphy.																																	
The Block 103 Inferred Mineral Resource (Greenbush Zone) is open towards the NW																																	
and SE and also at depth. If future drilling proves the existence of similar structures in																																	
"other parts of the Property, the current resource can be readily increased. This additional"																																	
tonnage potential exists within a 12 km strike length.

"The total iron grades have been included in this Report, but in WGM’s opinion, the TFe"

"was prepared by the Cap-Ex exploration team and was reviewed by Watts, Griffis and"																																	
"McOuat (WGM). It was provided to BBA on February 4th, 2013, in a Comma Separated"																																	
Value (CSV) file format.																																	
The variables provided with the model are shown in Table 16-1. The model includes																																	
"subdivisions of mineralized and non-mineralized rock types, with their corresponding"																																	
densities. All the mineralized rock types are classified as Inferred resources. For the																																	
"purpose of this study, Inferred resources have been used for pit generation, and have"																																	
"been converted to in-pit resources when economically suitable, in accordance with"																																	
NI 43-101 guidelines for a PEA.																																	
"The block model was imported into the MineSight 3D software, with no modification to"																																	
"the information given. The model was imported in local coordinates, based on a"																																	
"coordinate conversion from UTM NAD 83 to a local grid system, as described later in"																																	
this Chapter.																																	
"Following BBA’s validation of the block model after import, additional values were"																																	
created by BBA to carry out the mining study:																																	
"?	TOPO: percent of block below topographic surface;"																																	
"?	OB: percent of block below bedrock surface;"																																	
"?	WREC: concentrate weight yield rate."

"16.2	Pit Optimization"																																	
"For the purpose of the Block 103 PEA, pit optimizations were carried out using the"																																	
Lerchs-Grossman 3D (LG-3D) algorithm in MineSight. This optimizer is based on the																																	
"graph theory and calculates the net value of each block in the model, i.e., revenue minus"																																	
costs. The pit optimizer searches for the optimum economic pit shell that delineates the																																	
maximum volume of extraction. This is done by evaluating the revenues less mining and																																	
processing costs. Other parameters that contribute to the optimum economic pit shell																																	
"include processing recoveries (determined from testwork), weight recovery values and"																																	
the overall pit slope parameters.																																	
"16.2.1	Pit Optimizations Parameters"																																	
Table 16-2 summarizes the pit optimization parameters used in this study for the Block

"The mining costs for the mineralized material and waste material, at the start of the mine"																																	
"life, were estimated by BBA to be in the order of $4.02/t mined. From elevation 560 m"																																	
"downward, an incremental cost of $0.04$/t mined per bench is added in order to"																																	
"consider increased haulage distances. Other costs, such as rail transportation and port"																																	
"fees and G&A were estimated by BBA, in collaboration with Cap-Ex."

"16.3	Engineered Pit Design"																																	
The engineered pit design was carried out using the LG 3D pit shell as a guide.																																	
Operational features that are required for an open pit mine are added during the																																	
"engineering pit design process and include a haulage ramp, safety berms, bench face"																																	
"angles, inter-ramp angles, bench height and minimum operational widths."																																	
"16.3.1	Haul Roads"																																	
All in-pit ramps are 36 m wide to accommodate 320-tonne off-highway class rear-dump																																	
"trucks. The ramp width is sufficient to safely support two-way traffic, required to maintain"																																	
an uninterrupted haulage cycle. For the bottom three benches of the ultimate engineered																																	
"pit, where traffic is likely to be reduced, the road width is reduced to 20 m. Based on"																																	
"hauling experience from other mines operating under similar conditions, the maximum"																																	
recommended ramp gradient is 10% for all mine roads. Temporary ramps will be used in																																	
the early years of mine operations to shorten haulage distances to the crushers and																																	
"waste piles. As the pit depth increases with time, a final ramp will be developed to"																																	
access the mineralized material located at lower elevations.																																	
"16.3.2	Geotechnical Pit Slope"																																	
"For the purpose of this PEA and considering that no geotechnical data was available, pit"																																	
slopes were assumed constant in both rock and a generally thin layer of overburden																																	
material based on information available on similar projects. The main design parameters																																	
for the Block 103 pit design are as follows:																																	
"?	Face angle of 72°;"																																	
"?	Overall slope angle of 52°;"																																	
"?	Bench height of 20 m in a double-bench configuration (2 x 10 m);"

"16.4	In-pit Resource Estimate"																																	
The resources for the engineered pit design are based on the parameters described																																	
"previously. As discussed in Chapter 15 of this Report, CIM guidelines require that, for a"																																	
"PEA, all material classified as Measured, Indicated or Inferred be reported as in-pit"																																	
resources.																																	
The in-pit resources for the Block 103 are calculated at a cut-off grade of 10% MagFe																																	
"and are presented in Table 16-5. As can be seen, the resource for sustaining the first"																																	
"thirty years of operation is estimated at a total of 1,896 Mt, with an average grade of"																																	
"18.6% MagFe. The total waste rock contained within this pit is in the order of 832 Mt, and"																																	
overburden is in the order of 28 Mt. This results in a stripping ratio of 0.44.

"16.5	Mine Production Schedule and Methodology"																																	
The objective of the mine scheduling and planning process is to maximize the project’s																																	
"NPV, while attaining processing plant targeted tonnage. This is done by keeping pre-"																																	
"stripping to a minimum, while mining mineralized material in a starter pit specifically"																																	
selected for initial supply of mineralized material to the concentrator. It should be noted																																	
"that in developing the pre-stripping and first operating year mine plan, consideration was"																																	
given to generating adequate quantities of waste rock and overburden to allow for the																																	
initial construction phase of the TMF and polishing pond dams. The mine plan is																																	
"therefore developed to provide for this waste material during pre-production (Year 0), and"																																	
first year mineralized material production start-up (Year 1). It should be noted that Year 1

mineralized material production is based on processing using one production line with a																																	
ramp-up of 85% of concentrate production capacity. Year Y2 and thereafter are based on																																	
full two-line concentrate production capacity of 16 Mt/y.																																	
"The mine planning process is based on two optimized pit shells, or phases; the starter pit"																																	
and the 30-year pit. The starter pit shell is generated by using the same costs																																	
"parameters as the 30-year final pit, but using a lower selling price, therefore generating a"																																	
"pit of size sufficient for three to four years of production. From these two pit shells, an"																																	
"annual mine plan is created on the Microsoft Excel software, by determining the"																																	
"percentage of each bench to be mined every year, based on yearly specific mineralized"																																	
"material and waste requirements, until depletion of the deposit. The mine plan is then"																																	
refined to smooth out equipment fleet and optimize capital expenditures.																																	
"16.5.1	Mine Production Schedule"																																	
"16.5.1.1	Pre-Production and Construction"																																	
"For this PEA, a project and construction execution plan was not developed to any degree"																																	
of detail. It is assumed that site construction will take place over a period of two years																																	
"prior to start-up of the first production line. For mine planning purposes, all waste material"																																	
quantities required during the construction period have been summarized under Year 0																																	
of the mine plan. A total of 5.2 M in-situ cubic meters of rock material and 1.8 M in-situ																																	
cubic meters of overburden material are required to start the first line of production at the																																	
beginning of Year 1. Another 2.5 M in-situ cubic meters of rock material are required																																	
before Line 2 of production starts. Costs for mining waste have been estimated based on																																	
"usage of the mining equipment fleet, however, incremental costs for adjusted hauling"																																	
distances to the dams and costs related to handling using smaller trucks have been																																	
included in the TMF construction costs and are not reflected in the mining costs

"16.6	Waste Rock Pile Design"																																	
Two waste rock piles and one overburden pile were designed for placement of the																																	
"Block 103 waste material generated over the first thirty years of the mine life, net of the"																																	
material used for dam construction. The waste rock piles and overburden pile satisfy the																																	
required tonnages originating from the open pit mine and include a swell factor.																																	
"For this level of economic study, the waste pile parameters have been assumed by BBA,"																																	
based on similar projects. These geotechnical parameters should be studied further in																																	
the next study phase. The parameters for the design of waste and overburden piles are																																	
presented in Table 16-7.

"16.7	Mine Equipment and Operations"																																	
"Mining operations are based on a 24 hours per day, seven days per week and 360 days"																																	
per year production schedule. Two operating shifts per day yield 720 operating shifts per																																	
year. It is assumed that five mining operating days per year are lost due to bad weather																																	
"conditions, but processing operations are maintained using a ROM mineralized material"																																	
stockpile ahead of the crushers. Mine operations are divided into four activity groups: pit																																	
"operations, mine maintenance, engineering and geology."																																	
"16.7.1	Operating Time Assumptions"																																	
The operating shift parameters assumed for this Study are presented in Table 16-9. A																																	
"breakdown of scheduled delays, which includes inspection and fuelling, shift changes"																																	
"and breaks, is presented. The shift parameters are calculated separately for workers of"																																	
most primary equipment and for the drills. The difference in the two calculations is due to																																	
"the Job Efficiency Factor (JEF), which is lower for the drills, in order to take into account"																																	
the additional time required for displacing the drill between drill holes and extra spot time																																	
needed.																																	
Table 16-10 shows how the net Productive Operating Hours (NPOH) per shift are																																	
calculated once the scheduled and unscheduled delays are removed. Unscheduled																																	
"delays are those outside of human control, which cannot be forecasted. They are based"																																	
on similar operations in the area and on BBA’s experience. The Net Productive																																	
Operating Hours (NPOH) for the workers and a majority of the equipment are																																	
8.96 hours/shift and 8.06 hours/shift for the drills.

"16.7.2	Equipment Availability and Utilization"																																	
Mechanical availability and utilization factors are assigned for each piece of major																																	
"equipment over the life of the mine (LOM): the haul trucks, the shovels and the drills. The"																																	
mechanical availability considers the percentage of hours that the equipment is not																																	
available for operation due to planned maintenance or unplanned mechanical																																	
breakdowns. Utilization refers to the use of each piece of equipment during the hours																																	
"that the equipment is available. Thus, the utilization factor considers that a piece of"																																	
equipment is operative and productive.																																	
Table 16-11 shows the availability and utilization factors over the life of the mine. The																																	
variability of the percentages is based on previous studies and BBA’s internal database.

"16.7.3	Loading Parameters"																																	
The primary mining fleet for the Block 103 open-pit mine PEA consists of 320 t diesel																																	
"haul trucks, 30 m3 hydraulic shovels in mineralized material, 26 m3 hydraulic shovels in"																																	
waste and a 21 m3 wheel loader.																																	
The 320 t trucks were chosen primarily to account for the large amount of mineralized																																	
material being moved every year. The trucks and hydraulic shovels have been matched																																	
to keep passes between four and six.

Cap-Ex Iron Ore Ltd.																																	
NI 43-101 Technical Report																																	
The two 30 m3 bucket hydraulic shovels will be fully dedicated to mineralized material																																	
"removal. The first one will be required during Year 1, and the second one during Year 2."																																	
"The 26 m3 bucket hydraulic shovels will be used to remove leftover mineralized material,"																																	
waste and overburden material. A maximum of three 26 m3 shovels will be needed																																	
during periods of high stripping. A 21 m3 wheel loader is included for occasional																																	
assistance to the hydraulic shovels and other material handling duties. For the purpose																																	
"of this Study, it was assumed that all equipment would be diesel-operated. This was"																																	
done to reduce initial capital costs associated with building an electrical mine loop around																																	
the pit.																																	
Different bucket sizes were selected in mineralized material and waste to take into																																	
consideration the maximum loose densities of each material. The use of the shovels is																																	
"optimized by assuring that a shovel with any bucket size can, when required, handle"																																	
"mineralized material, waste and overburden material. This is done in order to represent"																																	
real-life mining operations in which the shovel may be moved around within the same																																	
day.																																	
"16.7.4	Hauling Parameters"																																	
The haulage parameters contributing to the determination of the truck fleet involve:																																	
"haulage road profiles, sequenced dumping, haulage speeds and fuel consumptions, and"																																	
load/spot/dump times incorporated in the final cycle times. The road haulage profiles are																																	
segmented into in-pit distances and distances exterior to the pit. The distances are																																	
further divided into the following:																																	
"?	In-pit flat haul;"																																	
"?	In-pit ramp;"																																	
"?	On surface outside of the pit;"																																	
"?	On stockpile/waste rock pile/crusher pad flat;"																																	
"?	On stockpile/waste rock pile/crusher pad ramp."

"For the purpose of this PEA, the in-pit flat distances are assumed to average 400 m. Pit"																																	
ramp distances were calculated based on an annual weighted average of the mining																																	
"depth. The distances on topography are calculated from a site plan, from the pit exit to"																																	
"the crusher pad, or designated waste rock pile."																																	
There will be three waste rock piles on site; two will be allocated to waste rock and one																																	
"will be allocated to overburden material. For the purpose of cycle time calculations, it is"																																	
"assumed that the waste material would first be hauled to the tailings dam site, until end"

"facilities will be limited to an explosives magazine, in proximity to the open pit, owned"																																	
and operated by the contractor and used to store blasting accessories.																																	
BBA recommends that a high-energy bulk emulsion explosive with electronic detonators																																	
"be considered for wet and dry conditions. With an in-hole density of 1.25 g/cc, emulsion"																																	
"has several environmental, logistical and operational advantages over ANFO or"																																	
"ANFO/Emulsion blend products, in addition to higher explosive energy. Using a 100%"																																	
"emulsion product, average power factors of 0.34 kg/t in mineralized material and"																																	
0.35 kg/t in waste rock can be obtained.																																	
Production blasting will utilize a system of electronic detonators that will allow for more																																	
precise and consistent blast results. The electronic detonator system can also allow for																																	
"better control of ground vibrations, which should help to minimize some of the"																																	
geotechnical risks associated with blasting. Electronic blasting systems have numerous																																	
additional benefits:																																	
"?	Precise timing of each detonator;"																																	
"?	Reduced ground vibrations;"																																	
"?	No possibility of accidental detonation;"																																	
"?	Elimination of cut-off hole risks (results in misfire and safety risks);"																																	
"?	Improved fragmentation."

The recommended blasting accessories per hole can be found in detail in Table 16-14.																																	
All holes are assumed to be double-primed (detonators and primers per hole) to minimize																																	
the likelihood of misfired holes and the safety risks associated with them.

"The primary equipment fleet was selected based on fleet utilization, reliability of"																																	
"equipment, supplier quotes and benchmarking of similar operations in the region. The"																																	
maximum quantity of primary equipment required over the life of mine (LOM) is as																																	
follows:																																	
"?	35 x 320 t diesel haul trucks;"																																	
"?	2 x 30 m3 bucket hydraulic shovels;"																																	
"?	3 x 26 m3 bucket hydraulic shovels;"																																	
"?	8 x 251mm (97/8 inch) rotary blast hole drills (RBHD)."																																	
Figure 16-13 shows the truck fleet over the life of mine (LOM). The peak is reached in																																	
Year 17 and lasts until Year 23.

"17.	RECOVERY METHODS"																																	
Chapter 13 of this Report describes the metallurgical testwork and how the results were																																	
used to derive the preliminary Process Flowsheet (PF) and mass balance forming the																																	
basis for determining the recovery method for Fe from the Block 103 deposit to produce																																	
a saleable acid pellet product.																																	
"In this section of the Report, a process design basis is established and is used to further"																																	
"develop, at a conceptual level, the mass and water balance and to develop the process"																																	
"design criteria, including the preliminary selection and sizing of major process"																																	
equipment. It should be noted that equipment sizing is preliminary and is generally																																	
based on a combination of the following:																																	
"?	Testwork results;"																																	
"?	Handbook references;"																																	
"?	BBA’s experience on other reference projects;"																																	
"?	Vendor information."																																	
General processing plant descriptions of various areas are provided and a preliminary																																	
site General Arrangement (GA) drawing was developed and is presented in Chapter 18																																	
of this Report. This information serves as input information for the development of the																																	
Capital and Operating Cost Estimates presented in Chapter 21.																																	
"17.1	Process Design Basis"																																	
Magnetic Fe (MagFe) will be recovered as a fine magnetic concentrate suitable as pellet																																	
feed. Plant design provides for the production of 16 Mt/y of concentrate feeding two																																	
pelletizing lines. Final pellet production is estimated to be in the order of 16.6 Mt/y of																																	
acid pellets.																																	
"As detailed in Chapter 13, the metallurgical performance forecasted for this project was"																																	
"derived from testwork executed to characterize the northern and eastern sectors, as well"																																	
as on an assumed particle size distribution typical of magnetic concentrators and in line																																	
with the liberation size as determined from the metallurgical testwork. Table 17-1

"17.3	General Process Description and Plant Design"																																	
General Process and Plant Design criteria and considerations for the Block103																																	
concentrator and pelletizing plant are based on the following:																																	
"?	The general location of the crusher, stockpile, concentrator, pellet plant, load-out,"																																	
"tailings disposal area, freshwater source and other major infrastructure is shown on"																																	
the general site plan developed in this Study. The site plan is presented in																																	
Figure 18-1;																																	
"?	Ore is crushed using two gyratory crushers. Crushed ore is fed from apron feeders"																																	
to two tripper conveyors discharging onto a large rectangular stockpile with a																																	
minimum 12-hour live load capacity;																																	
"?	The ore is reclaimed from the stockpile by apron feeders, feeding onto four SAG"																																	
mill feed conveyors to primary grinding;																																	
"?	Primary grinding is done by four dual-pinion SAG mills with variable speed, active"																																	
front-end type electric drives;																																	
"?	Mill discharge is screened using a two-stage screening circuit with primary single-"																																	
deck horizontal scalper screens and secondary classification (banana-type) single-																																	
deck screens. The oversize from both stages is recirculated to the SAG mills;																																	
"?	The flowsheet is based on staged wet, low intensity magnetic separation (LIMS)"																																	
concentration to produce a magnetite concentrate. A cobber LIMS removes as																																	
much liberated gangue material as possible before sending its concentrate to a																																	
"magnetic circuit composed of rougher and finisher LIMS, ball mill regrinding and"																																	
size classification (using hydrocyclones and screens). The magnetic circuit																																	
"downstream of the primary grinding and screening area is divided into three lines,"																																	
one for each regrind ball mill;																																	
"?	Concentrate from the magnetic circuit is dewatered in a dewatering stage LIMS and"																																	
slurry is pumped to the pelletizing plant agitated holding tanks.																																	
"?	Tailings from the cobber LIMS and from the magnetic circuit are collected by three"																																	
tailings thickeners (one per line). The underflow is directed to the tailings pumping																																	
system where three tailings pipelines are used for final disposal to the TMF;																																	
"?	Concentrate slurry from the concentrate holding tanks at the pelletizing plant is fed"																																	
to a series of vertical disc filters for dewatering. The resulting filter cake is mixed

with bentonite and is subsequently fed to balling discs for the production of green																																	
pellets. Green pellets are controlled for size before feeding two straight grate																																	
induration machines. The fired pellets are screened at the discharge where chips																																	
"are sent back for re-processing, while pellets are discharged by two conveyors into"																																	
a load-out silo common to both lines;																																	
"?	Pellets are transferred from the load-silo to a holding hopper feeding gondola-type"																																	
railcars;																																	
"?	Concentrator and pellet plant operations are based on a 365 days per year"																																	
operation with an overall plant utilization of 90%;																																	
"?	In general, there is sufficient redundancy incorporated into the Plant Design to"																																	
assure the required equipment availability to achieve the targeted plant utilization																																	
rate;																																	
"?	Major equipment sizing is to be considered preliminary and was estimated by one"																																	
or more of the following methods:																																	
"-	Vendor sizing/recommendation from project numbers provided by BBA;"																																	
"-	Vendor charts using testwork data or flowsheet balances with key"																																	
assumptions;																																	
"-	Using scaling factors to adjust from BBA’s reference projects;"																																	
The pellet plant design was based on vendor technology packages incorporating																																	
process equipment within prescribed battery limits.																																	
"17.4	Ore Crushing, Conveying and Storage"																																	
Ore from the mine will be delivered by truck to four dump points (two per crusher) at the																																	
primary crusher building. From the ore grindability testwork results and vendor																																	
"recommendation, it was determined that two 1,600 mm x 2,900 mm (63” x 114”), 750 kW"																																	
"(1,000 hp) gyratory crushers would provide the required crushing capacity."																																	
A hydraulic rock breaker operated from a control panel in the crusher operator’s room is																																	
provided adjacent to each crusher to break up and manipulate oversized or improperly																																	
positioned rocks. An overhead crane is located in the crusher building to service																																	
equipment. Both crusher buildings are enclosed within a building and provided with a

"wet scrubber and an air make-up unit. Scrubber effluent, floor wash-down water and"																																	
drainage are collected in a sump and pumped to a designated area.																																	
"Ore, crushed to a P80 of 135 mm in size, is collected in two surge pockets (one per"																																	
"crusher) located at the crusher discharge. From the surge pockets, the crushed ore is"																																	
fed to two tripper conveyors discharging onto an uncovered rectangular pile with a live																																	
"capacity of approximately 12 hours (100,000 tonnes). Crushed ore is reclaimed onto four"																																	
"1,524 mm-wide (60 in), SAG mill feed conveyors that run in a tunnel below the stockpile."																																	
"Each of the four conveyors is fed by three 1,830 mm wide x 7,000 mm long (6’ x 23’)"																																	
variable speed apron feeders (for a total of twelve apron feeders). The mill feed tonnage																																	
is controlled by varying the feeder speed with a signal from the belt weigh scale. A dust																																	
collection system will be provided. The mill feed conveyors have walkways on both sides																																	
and are enclosed within a gallery.																																	
"17.5	Grinding and Screening"																																	
The Grinding and Screening circuit proposed is similar to the design used in BBA’s																																	
reference projects. Crushed ore is fed to four SAG mills and discharge from each mill is																																	
directed to two primary horizontal scalping screens (eight scalping screens in total) with																																	
an aperture size of 5 mm. The oversized fraction from the primary screens is returned to																																	
the SAG mills by belt conveyor. The passing fraction from the screens is collected into																																	
two pump boxes (one per screen). Each of the two primary screen pump boxes is																																	
equipped with two single-stage pumps (one operating and one standby). For each SAG																																	
"mill, the primary screen undersize fraction is then fed to four multi-slope (banana-type)"																																	
secondary classification screens (sixteen secondary in total) with an aperture size of 2																																	
mm. The sizing screens are located in an area adjacent to the grinding area within a																																	
separate building. The oversize from the classification screens is collected on a belt																																	
conveyor and directed back to the SAG mill feed conveyor. The secondary screen																																	
"passing fraction is collected into two pump boxes, each pump box collecting slurry from"																																	
two secondary screens. Each of the two pump boxes handles half of each SAG mill																																	
throughput and is equipped with two single-stage pumps (one operating and one																																	
standby). The sizing screen product is pumped to the cobber LIMS.

P10o = 2 mm and P80 = 1 mm. Considering the limited grindability and ore hardness data																																	
"available for this Study, it is assumed that four 11,580 mm x 6,100 mm (38’x20’) dual-"																																	
"pinion SAG mills, each powered by two 10,000 kW (13,400 hp) motors for a total of"																																	
"20,000 kW (26,800 hp), will be adequate for primary grinding. These mills are sized to"																																	
"draw the required power for nominal tonnage and nominal ore hardness. With softer ore,"																																	
"throughput can be increased but with harder ore, throughput will need to be reduced. It"																																	
should be noted that these mills are available from vendors in a twin pinion configuration																																	
"but there are none presently in operation. For a higher cost, these mills can be designed"																																	
as ‘wrap-around’ type and such mills are currently in operation. Further discussions with																																	
vendors will be required at the next study phase to validate this choice of SAG mill.																																	
"17.6	Magnetic Separation and Regrind Circuit"																																	
"Downstream of the primary grinding and screening area, slurry is fed to magnetic"																																	
concentrating and ball mill regrind lines. The classification screen undersize slurry is fed																																	
to three cobber LIMS magnetic concentration lines. Each of the three cobber line																																	
"distributors feeds eight 1,220 mm x 3,660 mm (48”x144”) counter-rotation single drum"																																	
cobber LIMS (twenty-four cobber LIMS units in total). The cobber concentrate from each																																	
line is collected into launders and discharged into its own pump box. This pump box also																																	
collects the concentrate from the rougher LIMS.																																	
The cobber and rougher concentrates from each line are then pumped to eight 900 mm																																	
diameter hydrocyclones (twenty-four units in total) to be grouped in clusters. The																																	
"hydrocyclone produces an overflow P95 of 106 ?m, directed to the finisher LIMS"																																	
"distributor (one per line) ahead of the nine 1,220 mm x 3,660 mm (48”x144”) counter-"																																	
current double drum finisher LIMS (twenty-seven units in total). The underflow from the																																	
hydrocyclones is directed to the three ball mills for further regrind. The ball mill discharge																																	
"collects to a pump box that then feeds a distributor ahead of the ten 1,220 mm x 3,660"																																	
mm (48”x144”) counter-rotation single drum rougher LIMS (thirty rougher LIMS units in																																	
total).

The finisher LIMS concentrate is collected in distributors ahead of twenty-six stack-sizer																																	
type screens with a cut size of 75 ?m. Each stack-sizer unit consists of a five-deck																																	
screen with urethane screening decks. A total of seventy-six screens are provided. The																																	
oversize from these screening units is collected in launders and is fed back to the ball																																	
mills. The undersize is collected in distributors ahead of four dewatering LIMS units for																																	
each line (twelve units in total).																																	
"The cobber tailings are collected in a pump box (one per line) before being fed to seven,"																																	
"1,200 mm diameter dewatering hydrocyclones (twenty-four in total). The hydrocyclone"																																	
overflow has a P95 of 150 ?m and is collected into one 45 m tailings thickener that will																																	
also collect the rougher and finisher LIMS tailings for each line. There are therefore three																																	
tailings thickeners in total.																																	
"17.6.1	Regrind Ball Mill Sizing"																																	
"For this Study, it is assumed that regrinding is done using ball mills in closed circuit with"																																	
cyclones and screens. Preliminary sizing of the ball mill was determined assuming a																																	
"feed particle size distribution (F80) of 1,000 ?m, a mill product size (P80) of 150 ?m and"																																	
using grindability data from the testwork and Vendor handbook data. The regrind ball mill																																	
"selected is a 7,620 mm dia. X 11,740 mm (25’ x 38.5’), dual-pinion drive, with each"																																	
"pinion driven by a 7,500 kW (10,000 hp) fixed speed motor. Sizing was done using the"																																	
BWi from the testwork scaled to required F80 and P80 parameters. Three such ball mills																																	
will be required.																																	
"17.7	Tailings Dewatering and Pumping"																																	
Tailings from the cobber LIMS are dewatered using hydrocyclones. The rougher LIMS																																	
"and finisher LIMS tailings from each line, along with the cobber LIMS dewatering"																																	
"hydrocyclone overflow, are collected into a 45 m diameter tailings thickener. There is"																																	
one tailings thickener for each line (three in total). The underflow from the tailings																																	
thickener is pumped to a pump box that also collects the coarse tailings generated by																																	
"the cobber dewatering cyclone underflow. There are three tailings pump boxes in total,"																																	
each collecting the tailings from one line.

Each pump box will pump tailings through a 560 mm (22”) diameter rubber-lined pipeline																																	
with four stages of pumping for final disposal into the TMF. Each pump will have a																																	
"capacity of 932 kW (1250 hp). In total, there will be three pipelines with four pumps each"																																	
"(twelve pumps in total), all operating. Design provides that a fourth complete tailings"																																	
pumping back-up line will be installed once full capacity is reached.																																	
"17.8	Pellet Plant"																																	
"The pellet plant is designed as two lines, each receiving 8 Mt/y of concentrate slurry for"																																	
a total of 16 Mt/y producing 16.6 Mt/y of acid pellets. It should be noted that pellet plant																																	
capacity was derived from discussions with vendors based on their experience with																																	
similar ores. Testwork to confirm pellet quality and production rate will be required in the																																	
next study phase.																																	
This PEA was based on a vendor supplied technology package with prescribed battery																																	
limits. The induration technology is based on straight grate design. A general description																																	
of the pelletizing process follows.																																	
"17.8.1	Concentrate Reception and Dewatering"																																	
Concentrate from the dewatering LIMS is pumped to an agitated holding tank (two in																																	
total) ahead of the two pelletizing lines. Slurry from each holding tank is pumped to																																	
seven vertical vacuum disc filters (fourteen in total). Filter cake is directed to storage																																	
bins.																																	
"17.8.2	Additives Grinding"																																	
"Considering that design provides for production of only acid pellets, no flux storage or"																																	
"grinding is provided. The only additive is bentonite. Coarse bentonite is received, stored"																																	
"and ground in a roller mill. The bentonite, ground to 80% -74 pm (200 mesh) will be"																																	
pneumatically transported to the storage bins in the mixer area of the pellet plant.

"17.8.3	Mixing Area"																																	
The concentrate filter cake and the bentonite are blended and mixed in horizontal drum																																	
mixers where water is also added to achieve the required %-solids and consistency																																	
ahead of the balling operation. Provision will also be made for the addition of sodium																																	
"hydroxide to the mixers, as needed. Dust collection systems and other ancillary"																																	
equipment are provided.																																	
"17.8.4	Balling"																																	
The mixed material will be transported by a series of belt conveyors to the balling area.																																	
Rejected green balls from the green ball screening system and balling disc reversible																																	
discharge conveyors will be added to the mixed material downstream of the mixers. The																																	
balling area of the pellet plant will be of a conventional design with adjustable angle																																	
balling discs. Fourteen 7.5 m dia. balling disks per line (twenty-eight in total) are																																	
provided.																																	
Each disc will discharge the green pellets onto an individual reversible collecting belt in																																	
order to deliver them to the main collecting conveyor. The reversible belt will discharge																																	
any sub-par product to the recycle conveyor belt located under the disc floor.																																	
The main green pellets collecting belt will discharge onto a shuttle belt that runs on rail																																	
across the wide belt that feeds one double-deck roller screen per line (two in total).																																	
The function of the double-deck roller screen is to effectively remove the oversized																																	
pellets generated by the balling disc with the top deck and to remove the broken																																	
and -6.3 mm pellets with the lower deck. Green pellet fines and oversize will be returned																																	
together with the balling disc reversible rejects product conveyor to the mixed material																																	
stream on the way between the mixers and the balling feed bins.																																	
"17.8.5	Induration"																																	
The technology package considered for this PEA is based on the straight travelling grate																																	
induration machine design. The green pellets will be hardened on two Straight Grate																																	
induration machines. Each 4 m wide machine will have an area of 816 m2. It is advised

that in the next study phase a trade-off study be performed to compare straight grate																																	
design to rotary kiln design.																																	
A hearth layer is used to protect the grate bars and the side walls of the pellet car from																																	
excess heat that will otherwise accelerate damage. Only the larger sized fired pellets are																																	
used as a hearth layer.																																	
Green pellets will be dried in two stages: updraft followed by downdraft drying gas flow.																																	
The dried pellets will be preheated to a progressively higher temperature. The pellets will																																	
then be fired at approximately 1270°C. A short section designated as after firing allows																																	
the heat front to completely penetrate to the bottom of the pellet bed. Cooling is																																	
accomplished in two stages: by an updraft passage of ambient air supplied and by a																																	
cooling air fan. The cooled pellets shall leave the induration machine at 100°C or less.																																	
Gas cleaning and dust removal system will be provided and designed to comply with air																																	
emission regulations pertaining to dust concentration. This will be done using																																	
electrostatic precipitators (ESP) on the main gas streams (windbox and hood) and wet																																	
scrubbers at the feed and discharge of the machine. Collected dust is recycled back to																																	
the process.																																	
Spillage from the various areas of the machine will be collected on a dribble conveyor																																	
and recycled back to the process.																																	
The grate will be provided with a refractory lined hood above the machine and wind																																	
boxes below the machine. The hood will have water cooled sides and transverse lintels.																																	
"Internal dividing walls will separate zones in the hood, while moveable shell-shaped"																																	
dead plates will separate zones in the wind boxes. Two false wind boxes at the feed end																																	
of the machine will be connected to the exhaust gas to provide clean and cool conditions																																	
at the feed end of the machine.

"17.8.6	Machine Product Discharge Conveyor and Load-Out"																																	
Fired pellets from each induration line are discharged onto their respective conveyors																																	
designed to transport the pellets into a common exterior pellet load-out silo with a																																	
"capacity of 32,000 tonnes. This silo acts as a buffer between the pellet production plant"																																	
"and the pellet loading system, which is able to load railcars at a much faster rate than"																																	
the pellet production rate. The load-out silo can be bypassed if required and pellets can																																	
be directed onto two exterior emergency stockpiles. Pellets from the exterior emergency																																	
stockpiles are reclaimed as required by a loader that dumps into a hopper feeding a																																	
reclaim conveyor belt and returned to the load-out silo. The pellet load-out silo																																	
discharges onto a high speed conveyor that feeds into a load-out hopper. The hopper in																																	
turn discharges into 100 tonne gondola railcars. Weight in the railcars is controlled by																																	
controlling the railcar advancement speed and feeder feed rate with a feedback signal																																	
from a rail weigh scale.

"18.	PROJECT INFRASTRUCTURE"																																	
"18.1	General Block 103 Site Plot Plan"																																	
A conceptual Block 103 site plot plan presented in Figure 18-1 was developed as part of																																	
this PEA. The following approach was taken in order to develop the site plan:																																	
"?	A general review of the Property as well as of the adjacent areas was completed by"																																	
BBA in collaboration with the Cap-Ex exploration team. The known and potential																																	
"mineralization areas, as indicated by magnetic survey data, were identified and as a"																																	
"rule, major site infrastructure was kept outside of areas believed to be barren. This,"																																	
"however, needs to be validated in the next study phase. Other major constraints"																																	
imposed in developing the site plan were as follows:																																	
"-	All project activity and construction, with the possible exception of existing"																																	
"roads, are to stay within the Labrador border and outside Quebec permitting"																																	
jurisdiction.																																	
"-	Major lakes and waterways (Kivivik Lake, Greenbush Lake, Rosemary Lake)"																																	
are to be preserved with required buffer zones.																																	
"-	Major infrastructure will be located at a minimum of 500 m from the pit in order"																																	
to minimize risks related to blasting.																																	
"?	Considering that a large part of the property indicates some degree of mineralization,"																																	
"some infrastructure will need to be located outside of the Cap-Ex mineral claims, and"																																	
it is assumed that Cap-Ex will obtain surface rights to some of the adjacent																																	
properties.																																	
"?	Some consideration was given to place major infrastructure, such as the Tailings"																																	
"Management Facility (TMF) and the rail loop, in areas where the natural topography"																																	
is most accommodating.																																	
"?	In the absence of any geotechnical data, but considering that there is little"																																	
"overburden on and around the property, it was assumed that geotechnical conditions"																																	
will be somewhat favourable and site infrastructure will be located on competent																																	
bedrock.																																	
"?	Using the data from the resource block model derived from the exploration drilling,"																																	
the footprint of the ultimate pit shell was estimated at a conceptual level and located

"on the site plan. Furthermore, a pit shell containing sufficient resources (about 2Bt)"																																	
for a 30-year operation was also defined and indicated on the site plan.																																	
"?	The primary crusher building, process plant, pellet plant and mine services area are"																																	
all located in proximity of the pit. The favourable surrounding topography allows for																																	
the rail loop to be located near the pellet plant.																																	
"?	Areas for disposing of waste rock in proximity of the pit were defined and are"																																	
assumed to be barren. This needs to be further validated in the next study phase.																																	
Hauling distances are kept relatively short (approximately 3 km).																																	
"?	The location of the TMF and the polishing pond was derived based on relatively"																																	
favorable topographic features and proximity to the concentrator in an area indicated																																	
to be relatively barren. The natural topography minimizes the quantity of dam																																	
construction material required. This area is deemed to have adequate tailings																																	
storage capacity for at least the first thirty years of operations.																																	
"?	An existing road running along the eastern boundary of the property will be used as"																																	
the main access road to the site. This road connects to the primary road to																																	
Schefferville to the Southeast and provides New Millennium access to their																																	
Goodwood deposit to the North of the Block 103 Property. It is assumed that some																																	
overhaul will be required to parts of the existing road.																																	
"?	Mine haul roads will extend from the pit exit ramp to the waste rock piles, the crusher"																																	
building and dams of the TMF. Mine roads will be constructed using waste rock and																																	
overburden from the mining operation.																																	
"?	A rail loop for loading iron ore pellets into railcars will be located adjacent to the"																																	
pellet plant. A connecting railway will extend from the loop and will tie in to New																																	
Millennium’s rail about 10 km to the South.																																	
"?	A temporary construction camp will be required during construction of the facilities,"																																	
as well as a permanent camp for a fly-in-fly-out (FIFO) operation. The permanent																																	
camp will be used to complement the temporary camp during the construction phase																																	
of the project.																																	
"?	With regard to electrical power supply, Nalcor will be responsible for bringing power"																																	
to the Block 103 main electrical substation at the assumed voltage of 315 kV.																																	
"It should be noted that, should the areas where major infrastructure is located not be"																																	
"available for use, significant impact to capital and/or operating costs could result."

TMF	"•	The TMF designated location is on the south part of the property, in an area
assumed to be barren (but needs to be validated) and natural topography facilitates
tailings management and optimizes costs by minimizing material requirements for
dam construction. Furthermore, tailings pumping will be downhill, considering that
the processing plant is located at elevation 675 m and the maximum dam height
after 30 years of operation is at elevation 640 m.
•	The overall TMF footprint covers about 16 km2. The TMF holding volume is in the
order of 750 Mm3 and is expected to have the capacity to store the equivalent of
1,450 Mt of dry tailings.
•	Tailings water natural drainage will be from North East to South West, towards the
Rosemary Lake, where it will drain into a polishing pond.
•	Water from the polishing pond will be pumped back over a distance of about 6 km
to the concentrator. A barge-type reclaim water pump house will be located within
the polishing pond. Excess water will be treated at the polishing pond prior to
discharge into the local watershed."																																
Other	"•	A sewage treatment system will be provided.
•	A fire protection system will be provided for the various areas, including the camp.
•	A security system will be provided at each plant access and a gatehouse will be
provided at the entrance of the main access road, leading to the concentrator and
administration building."																																
"18.2	Tailings Management Facility and Polishing Pond"																																	
"In this Study, the TMF has been developed at a conceptual level. It is designed for the"																																	
permanent disposal of the tailings generated over the first thirty years of operation. It is																																	
"highly likely that, for operation beyond thirty (30) years, a new tailings disposal location"																																	
will need to be identified.																																	
"Process water pumped with the tailings, as well as filtrate water from the pellet plant"																																	
"concentrate filtering area, are directed to the TMF and collected within a polishing pond"																																	
"located in an area west of the TMF, where water naturally drains. This water is recycled"																																	
back to the concentrator process water tank. The polishing pond is sized adequately to																																	
handle seasonal hydrological fluctuations. Any excess water is treated as required prior																																	
to discharge to the local watershed.

It is assumed that waste rock and overburden will be of required quality to be used for																																	
"the construction of the dams, thus no materials other than locally available materials will"																																	
be required. The TMF will be built in phases. It is also assumed that the mine plan will be																																	
adjusted to provide sufficient initial material in the pre-stripping phase to allow for the																																	
construction of the first phase of the polishing pond and TMF dam. The dams are built																																	
"up over the years with waste rock using the downstream method, i.e. they are raised as"																																	
the level in the TMF increases. This method does not use tailings for the construction of																																	
"the dams, although the process generates coarse tailings in sufficient quantities to"																																	
enable its use for dam construction. A more detailed TMF design and tailings																																	
management strategy will need to be developed in subsequent studies.																																	
"To minimize costs, the dams around the TMF are semi-permeable and water is collected"																																	
in peripheral trenches discharging into the polishing pond. The polishing pond is																																	
"rendered impermeable, using appropriate materials assumed to be contained with the"																																	
overburden generated during the mining operation. The barge-type reclaim water																																	
"pumphouse at the polishing pond has a capacity in the order of 5,000 m3/h."																																	
"18.3	Fresh Water"																																	
Fresh water is introduced into the process from a pumphouse located in Rosemary																																	
"Lake. Fresh water serves as process make-up water, gland seal water, equipment"																																	
"cooling water, fire water, potable water and other such uses. The fresh water"																																	
"pumphouse has a capacity in the order of 2,500 m3/h. Fresh water is pumped to the"																																	
"concentrator fresh water tank for distribution within the concentrator, which is the major"																																	
"user, and from there it is also pumped to the mine service area, the employee camp and"																																	
the pellet plant.																																	
"18.4	Electricity"																																	
An estimation of the site-wide power consumption was made and a preliminary load list																																	
was developed. The major process consumers and their respective power requirements																																	
and electrical consumptions are presented in Table 18-2. Crushing and grinding are a																																	
major component of power consumption and were estimated with comminution

plant power consumption was provided by a pellet plant technology vendor.																																	
Infrastructure and auxiliaries were estimated using factors from reference projects.																																	
The site total power demand was estimated to be in the order of 245 MW. The annual																																	
"electricity consumption was estimated to be in the order of 1,915 GWH. For this study, it"																																	
"was assumed that all mine equipment, including shovels and drills, will all run on diesel."																																	
"Furthermore, the load list was used to develop a high level electrical Single Line"

concentrator pad within the property. Power will then be distributed from the substation																																	
to the various areas on the site. Emergency power will be provided by diesel generators.																																	
All building and process areas will be heated using fuel-oil-fired steam boilers and heat																																	
recuperation systems. The pellet plant is assumed to be self-sufficient in heat generation																																	
and will only require ventilation. It is not intended to use electricity for any significant																																	
space heating.

"As indicated in a press release by Cap-Ex, dated May 2, 2013, Cap-Ex is currently"																																	
"seeking a strategic partner for its Block 103 Project and, to date, has received"																																	
considerable expressions of interest from various parties. This is the current strategy																																	
Cap-Ex is adopting to promote the project and marketing the product from Block 103.																																	
"During the course of this PEA Study, Cap-Ex did not proceed with any formal market"																																	
study in relation to the marketing of pellets from Block 103.																																	
"For this Study, the estimated long-term commodity price forecast used in the Project"																																	
Financial Analysis was performed by BBA based on various public and private market																																	
"studies by reputable analysts and iron ore producers, opinions of industry experts and"																																	
other sources. The Financial Analysis for this Project is presented in Section 22 of this																																	
Report.																																	
"19.1	Iron Ore Market"																																	
"Cap-Ex believes that the development of the Block 103 deposit, with its size and quality"																																	
"(as estimated in this Study), can be supported by two main market factors:"																																	
"1.	Projected global crude steel production led by China;"																																	
"2.	Need for higher Fe grade and higher overall iron ore product quality to blend with"																																	
"lower quality products entering China, especially from Australia."																																	
The development of the Block 103 iron ore project relies strongly on projected future																																	
demand for iron ore products driven by projected growth in steel production. Figure 19-1																																	
presents projected crude steel production by region as recently forecasted by Rio Tinto.

Figure 19-1: Projected Global Growth in Steel Production																																	
"Global crude steel demand is expected to continue to grow moderately, driven mainly by"																																	
demand in China. Major iron ore producers are basing their expansion plans to be in line																																	
"with this forecasted growth in demand, as well as on evidence of sustained and"																																	
"increasing commodity price projections. Major producers such as Rio Tinto, Vale and"																																	
BHP express their views on supply and demand projections in recent presentations																																	
posted on their public websites. Crude steel production in China is forecasted to																																	
"continue to grow to over 900 Mt/y by 2020 and peak at about 1,000 Mt/y in 2030"																																	
(forecast by Rio Tinto). BBA has relied heavily on the forecasts of these producers to																																	
arrive at a commodity price estimate to use in the Financial Analysis for this Study.																																	
Another factor contributing favorably to the development of the Block 103 project is the																																	
continuing trend of decreasing quality of iron ore products; especially those produced in																																	
"Australia, where production of higher quality Brockman ores and other hematites have"																																	
been in decline and are replaced by lower grade Mamba and Channel iron ores. This is																																	
illustrated in Figure 19.2 (Source: Australia’s Iron Ore Product Quality - A Report on the																																	
"Quality of Iron Ore Resources in Australia, by Geoscience Australia Onshore Minerals"																																	
"and Energy Division, Author: Richard O’Brien, 2009)."

"Considering that Australia is a large iron ore exporter to China, it is anticipated that"																																	
higher Fe grade iron ore products with lower levels of deleterious elements will be in																																	
increasing demand in order to blend with these aforementioned lower quality ores.																																	
"19.2	Commodity Selling Price Assumptions"																																	
The Platts Index benchmark price for 62% Fe iron ore fines landed at China’s port is																																	
used as a base for developing the price for the commodity loaded in ship at port of																																	
"origin. Following its review, BBA concluded that a long-term iron ore concentrate"																																	
benchmark price of $110/t would be a reasonable price to use in the Financial Analysis																																	
in this PEA Study. This is not only supported by projected growth in steel production and																																	
"iron ore demand but also by a notional iron ore ”floor price”, which is believed to promote"																																	
price stabilization. Lower tier iron ore producers in China become unprofitable and curtail																																	
production when this ’’floor price” level is broken. It is generally agreed that this price is																																	
"between $110/t and $120/t. In recent history, when this floor price had been breached,"																																	
"prices rebounded and stabilized. In forecasting long-term pricing, supply and demand"																																	
come in balance and large price variations in the form of slides and spikes need to be

discounted. The effects of this floor price and how it acts as a moderating factor to																																	
longer term pricing are expressed by Rio Tinto and Fortescue in an article by Matt																																	
"Chambers in ‘The Australian’, dated August 30, 2012. In price forecasting, BBA has"																																	
considered the effects of this floor price as an important element in driving long-term																																	
pricing.																																	
After determining the forecasted benchmark Platts Index base price for 62% Fe iron ore																																	
"concentrate, two product-specific adjustments need to be made. The first adjustment"																																	
concerns the premium attributed to pellets (versus concentrate). BBA attributes a																																	
premium of $30/t for pellets. This is in line with recent settled prices but also with historic																																	
trends. The second adjustment concerns the premium attributed to iron ore products																																	
"grading above 62% Fe. For this Study, BBA attributes a premium of $5 per 1% Fe"																																	
content.																																	
The assumptions made in determining the commodity price to be used in the Financial																																	
"Analysis are subjective. In order to assess the robustness of the project, BBA has"																																	
conducted a sensitivity analysis based on commodity price that is presented in																																	
Section 22 of this Report.																																	
"19.3	Agreements and Contracts"																																	
"As of the effective date of this Report, Cap-Ex has not entered into any formal"																																	
agreement with third parties; although some informal discussions may have been																																	
"initiated. As part of project development, Cap-Ex will need to develop the following major"																																	
agreements with third parties.																																	
"?	Off-take agreements,"																																	
"?	Agreements with port terminal for pellet unloading, storage and reclaiming"

Significant environmental investigations and studies have been conducted on various																																	
properties surrounding the Block 103 Property as part of permitting and development																																	
work by other exploration and mining companies developing nearby projects. Based on																																	
"review of publicly available reports, it is understood that there are no reports of"																																	
"vulnerable or threatened fish, wildlife, or vegetation species in the general area. To date,"																																	
Cap-Ex has not conducted any baseline investigations or studies on the Block 103																																	
"Property. Furthermore, there are no known historical environmental investigations or"																																	
reports carried out by previous owners of the Property.																																	
"A small historical exploration camp existed along the northern boundary of the Property,"																																	
"near the Quebec border, where it is understood IOCC based its exploration activities. As"																																	
"part of the application for the 2012 exploration permit, Cap-Ex requested permission to"																																	
"use the former IOCC camp area as lay-down for exploration equipment, as the area was"																																	
already cleared/disturbed and could be accessed directly by the gravel road to																																	
"Schefferville. As part of this request, Cap-Ex committed to removing the several small,"																																	
"dilapidated, 5 m by 5 m camp buildings and dispose of the materials off-site. Cap-Ex"																																	
completed this clean-up of the former camp site in the summer of 2012.																																	
Cap-Ex understands the requirements for environmental baseline investigations and																																	
studies in support of the Environmental Assessment of project impacts as the Project																																	
moves towards development. Cap-Ex is planning for these studies as part of the overall																																	
Project exploration and development schedule.																																	
This section of the Report provides a general overview of the potential environmental																																	
"and social impacts of the Project, as well as general requirements and considerations for"																																	
compliance with federal and provincial regulations.																																	
"20.1	Environmental Setting"																																	
"The Property is located in the Labrador Trough, Newfoundland and Labrador,"																																	
"approximately 30 km northwest from the Town of Schefferville, QC. It is located"																																	
"immediately northeast of the Howells River system. The most prominent waterbodies,"

"lying within the Cap-Ex claims or in proximity, consist of Kivivic Lake and Rosemary"																																	
"Lake to the west, and Greenbush Lake to the east. The Property overlaps the Quebec"																																	
border to the east. The Project will be located entirely in the province of Newfoundland																																	
and Labrador and it is Cap-Ex’s intention not to undertake any new mining activities or																																	
build any new infrastructure in Quebec.																																	
Considering that no mining activities are planned in Quebec and that Cap-Ex does not																																	
"plan to build any infrastructure at the Port of Sept-lles, but will purchase services related"																																	
"to pellet unloading, reclaiming and ship loading, it is assumed, for this PEA Study, that"																																	
no permitting will be required from the Province of Quebec for the development of the																																	
Block 103 Project.																																	
"The proposed Block 103 Iron Ore Project is located within the Labrador Trough, in close"																																	
proximity of several other iron ore deposits that are at various stages of exploration or																																	
"project development. The Trough is a historic mining area, known for holding a large"																																	
"amount of undeveloped iron ore resources, following the occurrence of major magmatic"																																	
"events. Subsequently, the area has been hosting several mining projects since 1954. As"																																	
"a result of the volcanic activity, folding of sedimentary bedrock has led to a rugged"																																	
topography characterized by valleys and ridges ranging at elevations between 500 m																																	
and 700 m above sea level (asl). The Trough is also characterized by dispersed																																	
"wetlands occurring in valleys, where drainage is limited or high level groundwater exists."																																	
"Potential affected municipalities include the Town of Schefferville, Quebec, as it is the"																																	
"closest municipality, however, other mining projects are in closer proximity to"																																	
Schefferville than the Block 103 property is.																																	
"20.2	Jurisdiction, Applicable Laws and Regulations"																																	
All mining projects within the Province of Newfoundland and Labrador must comply with

Assessment and must be formally registered by the Project proponent. This process is																																	
administered by the Environmental Assessment Division (EAD) of the NL Department of

The Project proponent must then prepare an EIS incorporating component studies for																																	
"government and public review, fieldwork results and addressing all other requirements"																																	
stipulated in the government guidelines. The Project proponent will also need to																																	
implement a public information program in order to inform local residents and																																	
stakeholders of full Project details and allow them to raise concerns that will																																	
subsequently need to be recorded and addressed in the EIS. After public review of the																																	
"EIS and once it is determined that the information provided is sufficient, Cabinet will"																																	
"review the EIS and determine whether the Project should be released as presented,"																																	
released but with conditions or not released. Only once the Project is released from the																																	
"EA process, can the proponent proceed to obtain all the necessary permits and"																																	
authorizations in order to proceed with construction.																																	
"20.2.2	Federal Environmental Assessment Process"																																	
"There are various project elements that can trigger a federal EA, but as is typically the"																																	
"case with other similar mining projects, a federal EA would likely be triggered under the"																																	
Law List Regulations. Federal permits and approvals may be required for mining and																																	
"processing operations when project implementation impacts fish habitat (HADD),"																																	
navigability within navigable waters or requires on-site manufacturing of explosives.																																	
"The Fisheries Act deals with the conservation and protection of fish, the protection of fish"																																	
habitat and prevention of pollution. The Fisheries Act is the most likely federal EA trigger																																	
"for the Block 103 Project, which would result from implementing stream crossings for"																																	
roads and railways or from habitat losses related to any other project activities.																																	
Considering that the conceptual Project design attempts to avoid impact to any of the																																	
"more significant waterbodies on the Property, there is a possibility that the federal EA"																																	
may not be triggered.																																	
The Navigable Waters Protection Act ensures that navigation is not unimpeded along																																	
navigable waters. This is not a likely trigger for federal EA for the Block 103 Project.

"The TMF defined in this PEA, as indicated in the site plan in Chapter 18 of this Report,"																																	
has a volume of about 900 Mm3 at a dam elevation of 640 m. A3 m freeboard is																																	
"provided, thus the final elevation of the dam is at 643 m, but the working volume is within"																																	
the elevation 640 m. This volume could be increased by increasing the height of the																																	
dams or by mechanically dry-stacking tailings prior to final closure of the TMF.																																	
Preliminary calculations and assumptions indicate that this volume can be sufficient to																																	
accommodate the quantity of tailings generated during the first 30 years of operation.																																	
"The TMF was located in a large enough area, indicated and assumed to be"																																	
"non-economically mineralized, about 7 km southwest of the concentrator. Natural"																																	
"topography is used to minimize TMF dam construction material requirements, which is"																																	
assumed to be provided by mining operation waste rock and overburden. The TMF																																	
dams are constructed in phases and are raised progressively over the 30 years of																																	
"operation. Based on the analysis performed, waste rock quantities required for"																																	
progressive TMF dam construction were estimated and initial and sustaining capital																																	
costs were developed accordingly. This was done for the polishing pond as well.																																	
"In order to minimize costs for dam construction, the TMF dams are planned as semi-"																																	
"permeable dams with some geotextile liners in certain areas, thus seepage can be"																																	
expected. Peripheral trenches will be set up on the southwest end of the tailings pond for																																	
"the purpose of directing seepage towards the polishing pond. In this study, the possibility"																																	
"of using coarse tailings for dam construction has not been analyzed in sufficient detail,"																																	
but may present an opportunity and should be explored in the next study phase.																																	
Tailings will be deposited via pipeline at the north-eastern points of the TMF to allow flow																																	
by gravity across the pond. Coarse tailings will settle first near the deposition point and																																	
fine tailings will flow towards the polishing pond within a large volume allowing maximal																																	
settling time. The coarse tailings can be allowed to settle at higher elevations than the

"of the proposed area, the tailings pond will have an off-valley site arrangement. The area"																																	
is shown to consist of several areas with small ponds that seem boggy and poorly																																	
drained. Further investigation will be necessary to verify this and to allow for dams to be																																	
designed with adequate stability.																																	
The pellet plant and rail loop are located in proximity to the concentrator. The area																																	
chosen for the rail system was selected for its relatively flat topography at an elevation

"As can be observed from the data, seasonal precipitation and thaw cycles will be an"

polishing pond and TMF will need to be sized so that enough water can be accumulated																																	
and retained during periods of thaw and high precipitation in order to allow for year																																	
round operations. Peak demand periods can be supplemented by bringing in make-up																																	
"water from a fresh water source. For this PEA, it is assumed that fresh water"																																	
"requirements for the Project will be derived from Rosemary Lake, just west of the"																																	
"polishing pond, where a pumphouse having a capacity of 2,500 m3/h will be located. This"																																	
needs to be validated during the hydrological study. During periods of high inflows into																																	
"the TMF and polishing pond, it may happen that excess water will need to be released to"																																	
"the watershed. In such a case, the polishing pond should be designed to provide enough"																																	
residence time and possibly incorporate a water treatment plant to ensure that water																																	
discharge complies with water quality regulations.

Rehabilitation is defined as measures taken to restore the Property to a state that is as

"Similarly, on June 21, 2012, an MOU was negotiated with the Innu Nation of Labrador,"																																	
who has negotiated an Agreement in Principle (AIP) with respect to their aboriginal rights																																	
"over the properties being developed. Under this MOU, the Innu Nation has provided their"																																	
consent and has committed to enter into Impact and Benefits Agreement (IBA)																																	
discussions on the Project. There are two (2) other aboriginal communities in close																																	
proximity to the Cap-Ex properties who are asserting aboriginal rights over these																																	
properties; the Innu community of Matimekush-Lac John and the Naskapi community of																																	
Kawawchikamach. Cap-Ex has been in close contact with both communities during the																																	
2012 exploration activity in best efforts to ensure both benefited from employment and																																	
procurement contracts.																																	
Cap-Ex recognizes that all four (4) aboriginal communities have asserted land claims																																	
"and, in the case of the Innu Nation has negotiated an AIP and also recognizes that the"																																	
exploration activity and future development may affect the asserted or negotiated rights																																	
"of each of these communities. On that basis, Cap-Ex has communicated to each of"																																	
these communities its intent to negotiate a fair I BA with each that will provide																																	
"employment, contracts, training, education and social development opportunities, while"																																	
respecting the environment and their traditional way of life. Cap-Ex is therefore being																																	
responsible by assisting in the protection and enhancement of the aboriginal way of life.

Productivity factors were applied to the total number of direct hours estimated. These																																	
"factors do take into account some productivity loss experienced during winter conditions,"																																	
but a detailed analysis of productivity factors was beyond the scope of this Study.																																	
"21.1.4	General Direct Capital Costs"																																	
This Capital Cost Estimate is based on the construction of a greenfield facility having a																																	
"capacity to produce 16.6 Mt/y of standard acid pellets. The design of the crusher area,"																																	
"the crushed ore stockpile area, the concentrator area and site infrastructure has been"																																	
developed to a conceptual level and has been largely based BBA reference projects.																																	
BBA has developed this Capital Cost Estimate on the following assumptions and																																	
estimation methodology:																																	
"?	Mining equipment quantities and costs have been developed by BBA’s mining"																																	
group based on the mine plan developed in this Study. Equipment costs were																																	
estimated from BBA’s recently updated database of Vendor pricing. In order to																																	
"reduce initial mining equipment costs, it is assumed that Cap-Ex will lease-to-own"																																	
certain equipment that is required for pre-production and for Year 1 of operation.																																	
"?	Mine services area infrastructure capital costs, including mine garage, wash bay,"																																	
"tire shop, warehouse, employee facilities and other related infrastructure, were"																																	
"estimated by BBA engineering based on the site plan, as well as infrastructure for"																																	
similar project adjusted to Block 103 project requirements.																																	
"?	Pre-stripping costs incurred in the pre-production period have been capitalized."																																	
This Capital Cost Estimate is based on pre-stripping tonnage as defined in the mine																																	
plan and includes costs associated with the mining and hauling of overburden and																																	
"waste rock. In the mine plan, it was assured that enough waste material would be"																																	
generated to cover the needs of constructing the TMF dams.																																	
"?	The capital cost for the primary crusher area was estimated based on BBA’s"																																	
reference project using estimated quantities and updated unit costs. A budget price																																	
for the crushers was obtained from an equipment Vendor.

"?	The capital cost for the crushed ore stockpile and reclaim area was estimated"																																	
based on BBA’s reference projects adapting a revised layout for feeding four SAG																																	
production lines. Quantities were estimated using scaled factors and unit costs for																																	
commodities such as concrete and structural steel were updated.																																	
"?	The capital cost for the process area (grinding, screening, magnetic separation,"																																	
regrind and ancillary areas) was estimated based on BBA’s reference projects.																																	
Major process equipment was sized by BBA and budget prices were obtained from																																	
Vendors or from recently updated BBA database. Process buildings were sized																																	
based on layouts developed for other similar projects and scaled factors were then																																	
used to estimate major commodity quantities such as concrete and steel with																																	
updated unit costs. Other mechanical and related equipment quantities and sizes																																	
were estimated as a factor of major process equipment costs using factors in line																																	
"with other similar projects. Piping, electrical and automation quantities were"																																	
estimated in packages derived directly from BBA’s reference project and factored.

"?	The capital cost for the pellet plant was estimated based on a Vendor supplied"																																	
technology package within prescribed battery limits. Although a specific budget																																	
"price for the Block 103 project was not sought from vendors, BBA used other"																																	
similar vendor proposals and adapted them to the Block 103 project requirements.																																	
In general vendor proposals were well detailed allowing for estimates to be																																	
adjusted for local conditions pertaining to construction labor (rates and productivity)																																	
and construction commodities (concrete and structural steel).																																	
"?	The product load-out silo and emergency stockpiles were estimated based on"																																	
BBA’s reference project and scaled to requirements.																																	
"?	Site electrical includes the main substation and site distribution and assumes that"																																	
Nalcor will bring power at 315kV right to the main electrical substation. Capital																																	
costs were estimated based on the site plan layout as well as on an estimated load																																	
list developed by BBA process engineers and on a preliminary electrical single line																																	
diagram developed by BBA electrical engineering. Costs of major electrical																																	
components identified on the single line diagram were estimated using BBA’s																																	
recently updated internal database and were used to factor total electrical																																	
infrastructure costs.																																	
"?	Capital costs related to water management (reclaimed water system, fresh water"																																	
"system, effluent, etc.) were estimated by BBA engineering based on site plan and"																																	
water volumes and water balance estimated by BBA process engineers.																																	
"?	BBA estimated the cost of constructing a permanent camp for lodging operating"																																	
and administrative personnel based on a Fly-In-Fly-Out (FIFO) operation. The																																	
"camp includes individual rooms with showers, as well as common recreational"																																	
"facilities, kitchen and cafeteria. Based on personnel lists developed for the various"																																	
"areas, the camp was sized for 450 people. It should be noted that these facilities"																																	
are assumed to be available during project construction and are used to																																	
complement the temporary construction camp discussed later in Indirect Costs. In																																	
"discussions with Cap-Ex, it was decided that it should be assumed that Cap-Ex will"																																	
"lease these facilities from a third party operator. For this PEA therefore, no direct"																																	
capital costs have been attributed to the construction of the permanent camp and																																	
related costs are included in operating costs. Indirect costs for the construction of																																	
the camp are however included in the total initial capital costs.

The TMF and polishing pond dam construction quantities and unit costs were estimated																																	
"by BBA based in the site plan, site topography and design and implementation strategy"																																	
developed by BBA at a conceptual level as described in Chapter 18 of this Report.																																	
It was assumed that all backfill materials will be provided from the mine operation and no																																	
materials from outside the property were considered.																																	
"Unit costs for commodities such as concrete, structural steel, metal works and"																																	
architectural finishes were estimated from BBA’s internal database.																																	
"21.1.5	Indirect Costs"																																	
Indirect Costs were factored as a percentage of direct costs based on BBA experience																																	
on similar projects. Indirect Costs include such items as:																																	
"?	Costs related to the construction of temporary facilities required during the project"																																	
construction period.																																	
"?	Costs related to operating the construction camp."																																	
"?	Owner’s costs, which include items such as Owner’s team salaries and expenses,"

"?	Temporary construction facilities and mobile equipment used during construction."																																	
"?	Cost of sub-consultants, vendor reps and other third parties."																																	
"?	Costs for pre-operational acceptance of mechanical equipment."

"required for construction. For this PEA, the indirect costs were estimated at 36% of"																																	
direct costs for the concentrator and site infrastructure.																																	
"For the pellet plant, certain indirect costs (such as some EPCM services elements) were"																																	
included in the budget proposal from vendors. Only the elements that were clearly not in																																	
the vendor proposal were factored and incorporated into the Capital Cost estimate.																																	
"Following this analysis, additional indirect costs amounting to about 19% of direct costs"																																	
of the pellet plant were added to the pellet plant.																																	
"21.1.6	Contingency"																																	
Contingency provides an allowance to the Capital Cost Estimate for undeveloped details																																	
within the Scope of Work covered by the estimate. Contingency is not intended to take																																	
"into account items such as labour disruptions, weather related impediments, changes in"																																	
the scope of the Project from what is defined in the study nor does contingency take into																																	
account price escalation or currency fluctuations. For the concentrator and infrastructure																																	
"area, a contingency of 20% of the sum of Direct and Indirect Costs has been attributed"																																	
to the Capital Cost Estimate.																																	
"For the pellet plant, a contingency of 8% was added considering that the vendors’"																																	
proposals were made on a turn-key basis and it was assumed that vendors provided																																	
some level of contingency in their budget proposals.

"21.2.4	Railway Capital Costs"																																	
Capital Costs related to the construction of the rail infrastructure at the Block 103 site																																	
"have been estimated to be $54.5M comprising of the on-site rail loop for loading railcars,"																																	
on-site service track and the railway connecting the rail loop to the planned railway that																																	
"will service New Millennium, as indicated on the site plan in Chapter 18 of this Report."																																	
An all-in unit cost of $2.5M/km of railway was used to estimate capital costs assuming																																	
that the railway follows a stable topographic contour implying minimal cut-and-fill and																																	
considering that no significant water crossings are indicated.																																	
"As previously mentioned, costs for purchasing railcars are not included in capital costs"																																	
and are indicated as operating costs over the duration of the lease.

"21.2.5	Rehabilitation and Mine Closure Capital Costs"																																	
Rehabilitation and mine closure costs have been estimated by BBA factored from other																																	
"similar projects on the basis of footprint of waste piles and TMF, as well as on estimated"																																	
footprint of process buildings and site infrastructure. The estimated cost is $80M.																																	
Considering that regulatory guidelines from the Provincial Mining Act require that																																	
"Financial Assurance be posted as part of the Rehabilitation and Closure Plan, this cost"																																	
is not considered as a capital cost and is treated separately in the Financial Analysis																																	
"presented in Chapter 22. For the purpose of this Study, it was assumed that $70M of the"																																	
aforementioned total estimated amount will be required as an initial Financial Assurance																																	
for the Project prior to commencement of production of the first line and the remaining																																	
$10M will be required in the first year of production.																																	
"21.3	Estimated Operating Costs"																																	
Table 21-8 presents the estimated operating costs in detail for the Project on an annual																																	
"basis. As stated earlier in this Report, certain mining equipment and railcars have been"																																	
excluded from capital costs and added as leased items in the operating costs for the life																																	
of the lease. Mining costs vary from year to year based on the mine plan. Mining pre-																																	
"stripping costs have been estimated using the mining operating cost model, however"																																	
"these have been capitalized, therefore are excluded from operating costs."																																	
The average operating cost over the life of the mine has been estimated at $62.87/t of																																	
"pellets produced. This cost is inclusive of production costs, site costs, administration"																																	
"costs, environmental and tailings management costs, rail transportation costs and"																																	
"concentrate handling and loading into shipping vessels. This cost excludes royalties,"																																	
which are treated separately in the Financial Analysis presented in Chapter 22.

The Internal Rate of Return (IRR) on total investment was calculated based on 100%																																	
equity financing. The Net Present Value (NPV) resulting from the net cash flow																																	
"generated by the Project, based on a discounting rate between 0% and 10%, was also"																																	
calculated. The Project Base Case NPV was calculated based on a discounting rate of																																	
"8%. The payback period is also indicated as a financial measure. Furthermore, a"																																	
sensitivity analysis was also performed to assess the impact of a +/-25% variation of the																																	
"Project initial capital cost, annual operating costs and pellet selling price. The Financial"																																	
Analysis was performed with the following assumptions and basis:																																	
"?	The Project Execution Schedule and Key Milestones Developed in this Study."																																	
"?	The Financial Analysis was performed for the first thirty years of mine life. Based on"																																	
"the estimated size of the resource in the Block 103 deposit, operations are"																																	
expected to last well beyond thirty years.																																	
"?	A commodity selling price of $145/t of acid pellets grading at 67% Fe, loaded in"																																	
"ship (FOB) at Port of Sept-lles, was used. This price was derived from a forecasted"																																	
"long-term Platts Index benchmark price of $110/t of concentrate grading 62% Fe,"																																	
as discussed in Chapter 19 of this Report and adjusted to account for the following																																	
factors:																																	
"-	A pellet premium of $30/t was added to the concentrate benchmark price."																																	
"-	A premium of $25/t was applied to account for the pellet grade of 67.0% Fe."																																	
"-	Shipping costs from Port of Sept-lles to port in China (CFR) are assumed to"																																	
be in the order of $20/t pellet.																																	
? No other quality-based premium or penalty was considered.																																	
? All of the pellet product is sold in the same year of production.

"In this PEA, the Financial Analysis was carried out on a pre-tax basis. It is expected that"																																	
"the Project will be subjected to three (3) levels of taxation, including federal income tax,"																																	
provincial income tax and provincial mining taxes. An after tax analysis is beyond the

A Preliminary Economic Assessment is preliminary in nature and includes inferred																																	
mineral resources that are considered too speculative geologically to have economic

"22.2	Risk Management"																																	
"22.2.1	Scope"																																	
BBA’s approach to Risk Management in the context of this Study is to identify major																																	
risks associated with this Project in terms of the following categories:																																	
"?	Technology and technical risk"																																	
"?	Risk related to meeting the targeted project schedule"																																	
"?	Risk affecting CAPEX"																																	
"?	Risk affecting OPEX"																																	
Risk Management is a continuous process that is performed over the full life-cycle of																																	
"project development. Consequently, the data and information presented in this Report is"																																	
a snapshot of the project risk profile as understood on the effective date of this Report. It																																	
"will be noted that because of the continuous nature of the Risk Management process,"																																	
many open risk issues exist at this time. A review of the Risk Register will show that not																																	
all risks have been fully evaluated nor are they accompanied by well-defined mitigation																																	
"plans or actions, since these are to be updated regularly."																																	
"22.2.2	Risk Assessment Methodology"																																	
Risk identification is the process of examining the various project components and each																																	
critical process in order to identify and document any associated risks. A preliminary																																	
Risk Register was compiled by BBA for this Study and reviewed with Cap-Ex technical																																	
personnel.																																	
"For this study, risk assessment was conducted on a qualitative basis. For each of the"																																	
"identified risks, the Probability of Occurrence and Manageability was assessed and"																																	
qualified on three levels. These are indicated in Table 22-4. The consequence																																	
"associated with the risk was qualified in the Risk Register, but only as a description."

"23.	ADJACENT PROPERTIES"																																	
The Cap-Ex Block 103 Property is located immediately NE of the Howells River system.																																	
Tata Steel Global Minerals Holdings Pte Ltd. (Tata Steel) / New Millennium’s LabMag																																	
and KeMag projects are located on the SE side of the Howells River in Newfoundland																																	
and Labrador. New Millennium’s LabMag deposit is located just 2 km SW of Block 103.																																	
"The KeMag deposit, in Quebec, is located approximately 9 km NW of the Block 103"																																	
Property. Both LabMag and KeMag are taconite projects similar to Cap-Ex’s Greenbush																																	
Zone. They are similar in the fact that they propose to exploit magnetite-rich taconites																																	
within approximately the same iron formation stratigraphy. New Millennium released its																																	
first Mineral Resource estimate for the LabMag deposit in 2006. The initial Mineral																																	
Resource estimate for the KeMag deposit was completed in 2007. Prefeasibility studies																																	
"for the LabMag and KeMag projects were completed in 2006 and 2009, respectively. A"																																	
"Feasibility Study for the projects was started in 2011. In February 2013, New Millennium"																																	
"announced Mineral Resources for part of their Property, called the Sheps Lake property"																																	
"and the Perrault Lake deposit, south of the LabMag deposit. Tata Steel and New"																																	
Millennium also operate a DSO project closer to Schefferville.																																	
Century Iron Mines Corporation (Century) also holds property in the area. Its Sunny																																	
"Lake project, including the Rainy Lake Section, has both taconite and DSO potential."																																	
"Century’s Full Moon deposit at Rainy Lake is located in Quebec, approximately 40 km"																																	
"NW of Block 103. On October 22, 2012, the Company announced its first Mineral"																																	
Resource statement for the Rainy Lake iron deposit. It was based on 2011 and 2012																																	
"program drillholes totalling 22,900 m in 124 holes. Like the Greenbush Zone, Rainy Lake"																																	
mineralization is stacked by folding and faulting. Century has two partners: WISCO																																	
International Resources Development & Investment Limited (WISCO) and Minmetals																																	
"Exploration & Development (Luxembourg) Limited S.a r.l., both state-owned Chinese"																																	
companies.																																	
"Adriana’s Lac Otelnuk property is located further to the northwest, approximately 100 km"																																	
NW of Block 103. The Lac Otelnuk deposit is also taconite. WISCO also owns 60% of																																	
the Lac Otelnuk project. Its first Mineral Resource was released in 2009. Negotiations to																																	
commence a feasibility study are currently under discussion.

"25.	INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS"																																	
The main conclusions drawn from this PEA Study are as follows:																																	
"25.1	Mineral Resources"																																	
"?	Mineralization on the Property comprises magnetite-rich taconite iron formation of"																																	
the Sokoman Formation.																																	
"?	The Greenbush Zone on the Property lies within the Schefferville LTZ. The"																																	
"lithological units in the Schefferville Zone, including the Sokoman and other"																																	
"Ferriman Group members, have been stacked by folding and low angle thrust"																																	
faulting into a series of inclined imbricate slices. The result is an assemblage where																																	
the Sokoman Iron Formation repeats on itself providing increased volumes of																																	
mineralization over shorter strike lengths. Waste lithologies may also repeat in the																																	
juxtaposed units separated by thrust faults or tight folds.																																	
"?	The Project database is adequate to support the Mineral Resource estimate. The"																																	
sample/assay information is generally of excellent quality but some sample/assay																																	
issues persist. WGM regards these issues as immaterial to the current Mineral																																	
"Resource estimate but higher levels of data scrutiny, issue follow-up and check"																																	
assaying would improve data quality.																																	
"?	The geological interpretation is based on 2012 and 2011 drilling, surface geological"																																	
mapping and geophysical surveys. This information is not sufficient for completely																																	
"defining mineralization in the Greenbush Zone, but forms an adequate basis for"																																	
Inferred Mineral Resources.																																	
"?	A substantial deposit of taconite exists on the Property. With the currently available"																																	
"information from the drilling campaigns, the mineral resource estimate for the"																																	
Property is summarized in Table 25.1.

The Greenbush Zone is open towards the NW and SE and also at depth; additional																																	
tonnage potential exists within a 12 km strike length.																																	
The block model for the Block 103 deposit was provided to BBA. Following pit																																	
"optimization using specific economic and metallurgical performance parameters, a pit"																																	
shell was developed for the deposit at 10% magFe cut-off grade (COG) and the																																	
estimated resource is shown in Table 25.2.																																	
A Preliminary Economic Assessment is preliminary in nature and includes Inferred																																	
Mineral Resources that are considered too speculative geologically to have economic																																	
considerations applied to them that would enable them to be categorized as Mineral																																	
"Reserves, and there is no certainty that the Preliminary Economic Assessment will be"																																	
realized.

"25.2	Metallurgy and Ore Processing"																																	
The testwork program undertaken in this PEA Study was aimed at establishing a																																	
"baseline characterization of the mineralogy, metallurgy and grindability of the Block 103"																																	
deposit. The testwork program is typical for taconite type ore.																																	
"At the early stages of the PEA, a sample selection and sample compositing strategy was"																																	
"developed in collaboration with the Cap-Ex geology team, based on the limited"																																	
understanding of the deposit at that time. The deposit was classified into five main																																	
"sectors, as follows, based on drill core material available for sample compositing:"																																	
"?	North Upper Horizon (NUH)"																																	
"?	East Upper Horizon (EUH)"																																	
"?	East Lower Horizon (ELH)"																																	
"?	West Upper Horizon (WUH)"																																	
"?	West Lower Horizon (WLH)"																																	
"The deposit was therefore divided into a North, East and West regions, and the East and"																																	
West regions each had an upper and lower horizon.																																	
The results obtained from the testwork allowed for the development of a conceptual																																	
process flowsheet and mass balance based on the forecasted metallurgical performance																																	
and ore grindability parameters.

resources to Measured and Indicated.																																	
"?	Risks associated with assumptions made in the PEA regarding pit slopes as being"																																	
"too aggressive, which can be mitigated by proceeding with geotechnical testwork"																																	
and pit slope study.																																	
"?	Risks associated with the site plan development proposed in the PEA related to the"																																	
"location of major infrastructure, which can be mitigated by conducting"																																	
condemnation drilling and a study to identify off-property potential locations for																																	
TMF.																																	
"?	Risks associated with assumptions made in the PEA concerning railway"																																	
"transportation, which can be mitigated by early engagement with the concerned"																																	
railway carriers to secure transportation capacity.																																	
"?	Risks associated with assumptions made in the PEA regarding the port terminal,"																																	
which can be mitigated by early engagement with other potential users and/or																																	
potential port terminal operators.																																	
"?	Risks related to construction costs due to lack of geotechnical information, which"																																	
can be mitigated by performing a site-wide geotechnical study.																																	
"?	Risks related to ore processing and metallurgical performance that can be mitigated"																																	
"by conducting more detailed metallurgical, grindability and pelletizing testwork."																																	
"?	Risks associated with environmental permitting were deemed to be relatively low,"																																	
considering other mining operations in the vicinity are already ongoing and other

"26.	RECOMMENDATIONS"																																	
The following recommendations are made considering the results of this PEA Study and																																	
the project risks identified.																																	
"?	Continue to simplify the Project database by making field names more systematic"																																	
and consistent;																																	
"?	Pursue follow-up of outstanding sample/assay QA/QC issues. Further define and"																																	
clarify QA/QC follow-up policy;																																	
"?	Consider adding hand-held magnetic susceptibility measurements of core to the"																																	
core logging protocol;																																	
"?	Complete additional bulk density measurements;"																																	
"?	Complete surveying and checking and re-surveying of drillhole collars;"																																	
"?	Complete program reports for each drillhole campaign to document program"																																	
"components, specifications and results;"																																	
"?	Folding and thrust faulting of the sedimentary packages in the Property area is"																																	
complicated and has increased the thickness of mineralized Sokomon Formation in																																	
the central part of Block 103 (Greenbush Zone) by stacking of the stratigraphy.																																	
Substantial additional drilling is recommended to upgrade the current Mineral																																	
Resources;																																	
"?	There is considerable hematite and other non-recoverable components of the iron"																																	
mineralization in the Greenbush Zone. The TFe assays and averages do not offer a																																	
representative measure of the deposit. Preliminary metallurgical testwork results																																	
performed in PEA Study suggest that the hemaitite is very fine in nature and is not																																	
likely to be economically recoverable. It is recommended that magnetite and Fe in																																	
magnetite be used and highlighted to represent the economically recoverable part																																	
of the deposit;																																	
"?	Based on the large resource identified to date, it is recommended that a drilling"																																	
program focused on upgrading the currently Inferred category Mineral Resource																																	
estimate to Measured and Indicated categories within a planned 30 year pit area																																	
"(equivalent to about 2 billion tonnes), as defined in this PEA Study, be completed."
